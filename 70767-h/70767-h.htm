</div>


<p>The richness and variety of the professional papers left by
Frederick Law Olmsted, Senior, is astonishing, especially in
view of the enormous amount of work on the ground which he
accomplished in the almost forty years of his active career as
a Landscape Architect. Orderly and thorough by habit of
thought, he wrote down with minute care the various steps of
his professional dealings, in many cases retaining unused
drafts which show valuable processes of mind. From the
beginning he realized fully the importance of presenting the
new profession to the public in a favorable light, and was
constantly “coming before the public,”—as the phrase went,—in
the daily press and in occasional pamphlets. Several of
his professional reports also were printed at his own expense,
but a far greater number have lain buried in the files of Park
Department Documents or have never been printed in any
form. His personal life after 1857 was so closely bound up
with his professional activities that his family and friendly
letters reveal many sidelights on his work. The record of his
professional correspondence is fortunately full. When the
political harassments to which he was subjected prevented
him from sleeping, he used to while away the hours of the
night by writing, sometimes in regard to his current problems
and sometimes bits of general wisdom gained in his professional
experience. About 1890 when he was obliged in some
degree to lessen his travelling about, he wrote several long
retrospective letters, reviewing his career, and he left also
two or three short fragments of autobiography, which are
included in this present volume.</p>

<p>Among the many people outside the Olmsted family who
had preserved and were able to return letters for editorial
purposes, there should be especially mentioned: the late
Frederick J. Kingsbury of Waterbury, Conn., who added to
the letters a valuable group of reminiscences; Miss Emma
Brace (letters to her father Charles Loring Brace) who assisted
also in the preliminary sorting of Olmsted letters; Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span>
Sarah Norton (letters to her father Charles Eliot Norton);
and the Vaux family, who have aided the editors of Mr.
Olmsted’s papers in every possible way, Mr. Bowyer Vaux
especially, and given permission for the publication in Vol.
Two of several very illuminating letters from Calvert Vaux
to Mr. Olmsted, in 1864-65, which formed a turning point in
the latter’s career.</p>

<p>The present volume of Mr. Olmsted’s papers is intended
as an introduction to a series covering his main activities as a
Landscape Architect. The writings are to be arranged by
large groups, according to the nature of the works in connection
with which they were written,—public parks and park
systems, town plans, land subdivisions, grounds for public
and semi-public buildings, private estates, and so on. This
somewhat arbitrary rather than sequential arrangement is
adopted perforce because Mr. Olmsted’s writings—illuminating
as they are in regard to principles of wide application—relate,
with few exceptions, directly to some specific problem
or set of conditions, dealing with the case now from the
point of view of æsthetics, now from that of utility and convenience
or economy, sometimes from that of the sociologist,
sometimes from that of the administrator or that of the
artisan.</p>

<p>Mr. Olmsted wrote not primarily to set forth general
theories but to show how to get satisfactory results under
actual specific circumstances and requirements as he found
them, or to carry conviction of the wisdom of certain courses
of action which he advised.</p>

<p>In this connection it is interesting to compare his professional
writings with those of A. J. Downing,—whose friendship
unquestionably did much to stimulate and develop Mr.
Olmsted’s interest in landscape matters, and whose activities
in the Central Park campaign and in bringing Calvert Vaux
into relations with Mr. Olmsted led the latter so unexpectedly
into the profession. It is very striking to note the contrast
between Downing’s somewhat doctrinaire and <i>a priori</i>
method of discussing landscape problems, and Mr. Olmsted’s
habitual method, which was frankly to envisage the peculiar
facts of each situation as an individual problem to be solved
on its own merits in its own individual way, and then to test
and perhaps correct his conclusions by reasoning back to find
principles consistent alike with the facts and artistic intuitions
present in this particular case and with other principles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</span>
and theories accepted by him as sound and true. He looked
on theories and “principles” as valuable tools of service,
inevitably incomplete and defective, frequently in need of
reshaping, sharpening and improvement, and he was seldom
tempted to overlook or minimize new and special factors in a
problem merely because their recognition would force him to
modify what he had come to regard as firmly established
principles.</p>

<p>As a result of his method of writing Mr. Olmsted’s published
papers must necessarily be a somewhat disjointed compilation,
passages of the greatest interest and value for their
applicability to problems of residential property occurring in
the discussion of a park problem and vice versa, points of
detail in matters of technique sometimes coming cheek by
jowl with discussions of fundamentally controlling purposes.
It is proposed, however, to round out the series by a general
volume which will weave together many fragments and extracts,—mainly
from letters and reports not considered
worthy of presentation <i>in extenso</i> in the previous volumes,
together with connecting and explanatory matter by F. L.
Olmsted, Junior,—into an orderly and consistent presentation
of the theory and practice of the landscape art as developed
by Frederick Law Olmsted, Senior. This last volume
is also to contain a full subject index to all the material in the
whole series of volumes, thus opening for ready reference
a mine of information on hundreds of topics in the field of
landscape architecture and administration of public works.</p>

<p>While Volume One is devoted to the background of Mr.
Olmsted’s professional career, Volume Two will deal with his
first professional undertaking, the New York Central Park,
designed in coöperation with Calvert Vaux, which marks the
beginning of a new era of parks and of civic design in America.
On this account it has seemed desirable to give a much fuller
presentation of Mr. Olmsted’s papers relating to Central
Park than can be given to any other single example of design.
This is the more justifiable because many of the later park
reports repeat and develop principles first stated in connection
with Central Park.</p>

<p>Furthermore the history of Central Park is considered
of such importance in the development of the City of New
York that the Russell Sage Foundation, in connection with
the survey of Greater New York and Environs, has made a
special grant to enable the editors of the Olmsted Papers to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</span>
produce a monograph on Central Park which shall not only
present the Park from the standpoint of design, but shall also
give a connected history of its conception, design, construction,
and management up to the time of its fullest development
before its principal designers lost touch with it in the
80’s. The volume will therefore offer not merely, or even
primarily, Mr. Olmsted’s personal contribution as a designer,
but rather the conception of the park as he always regarded
it,—as a great collaborative effort in and for a democratic
community.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The editorial work on the great mass of Mr. Olmsted’s
papers personal and professional was begun soon after his
death by F. L. Olmsted, Junior. At this time, 1903-04, the
bulk of the papers was gone over and separated into the more
and less important, and a beginning made on their arrangement,
with the assistance of Mr. Philip P. Sharples. In the
spring of 1920, Mr. F. L. Olmsted engaged the present
editor’s services to bring the material into definitive form for
publication, while Mrs. Frederick Law Olmsted, Senior, was
still alive to lend the aid of her memory to the work. During
the summer and fall of 1920 Mrs. Olmsted, at ninety years of
age, made it her major occupation, saw the scheme of the
whole series of volumes take shape, and approved the selection
of material for the first volume, in which she herself had
perhaps the greatest personal interest. It was hoped that the
first volume might appear on the hundredth anniversary of
Mr. Olmsted’s birth, April 26, 1922, and that she might live
to see it published. She died on April 23, 1921, but not before
she had helped the work immeasurably not only by her
discriminating advice but by the inspiration of her interest.</p>

<p>The whole work has been subject to the direction, criticism,
and approval of the present Mr. Frederick Law Olmsted,
who has made the editorial work and publication possible,
and has added some of the brief explanatory notes.</p>

             Just after this, he wrote to a friend; “You can
             have no idea what a drag life had been to me for
             three years or more. I did not appreciate it myself
             until I began last summer to get better. The
             turning point appears to have been an abandonment
             of New York.... I have done much hard
             and steady work. The pamphlet of which you
             speak was mostly written after midnight and did
             not prevent me from getting regularly five or six
             hours refreshing sleep. I enjoy this suburban
             country beyond expression and in fact, the older I
             grow, find my capacity for enjoyment increasing.
             We have had great trials and agitations in the last
             year but the result of the whole has been with all
             tranquillizing. I am to turn sixty with two grandsons.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>

             and miscellaneous democracy.” Mr. Burnham

             him who stands first in the heart and confidence of
             American artists, the creator of your own parks

             lakes and wooded slopes; with lawns and banks and
             forest-covered hills; with mountain-sides and
             ocean views. He should stand where I do to-night,

<p>Of the early influences and experiences which contributed
to Mr. Olmsted’s unconscious preparation for his
later professional practice, we have fortunately a considerable
record. Towards the close of the seventies, when
he was harried beyond measure by the New York politicians,
he set down some fragmentary autobiographical notes as
the first part of an intended book reviewing American social
and political conditions.</p>

<p>In a little prefatory note, he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>... I offer a small contribution of individual experience
towards the history of the latter half of the first century
of the American republic,—the period in which the work of
the railroad, the electric telegraph, the ocean steamship, the
Darwinian hypothesis, and of Universal suffrage began; in
which what is called the temperance reformation and the
abolition of slavery have occurred; in which millions of
people have been concentrating at New York, Philadelphia,
Boston, Baltimore, Cincinnati, Chicago, St. Louis, and San
Francisco, while rural neighborhoods in New England, Virginia,
the Carolinas and Georgia have been rapidly losing
population and still more rapidly losing various forms of
wealth and worth.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>The book was never written, but he preserved such pages
of manuscript as he found time to scribble off,—often at
night when the strain of his bitter fight for the right development
of the Central Park left him sleepless and when he
turned with relief to the recollections of a simple and harmonious
social group.</p>

<p>My father was well fitted to live only in a highly organized
community in which man’s stint is measured out to him
according to his strength. As the world is going he was perhaps
as fortunately placed in this respect as he well could be.
Yet the world was driving along so fast that he lived in perplexity
between his self-distrust and disposition to acquit
himself fully in his proper part, and the supposed demands of
Society, Religion and Commerce.</p>

<p>The affectations by which he aimed to hide his unreadiness
were so transparent and his real qualities had so little
of brilliancy that he passed with others, even with many of
his friends, for a man of much less worth, ability and attainments
than he was.</p>

<p>If one had said to my father that he was highly sensitive
to beauty he would have straightened himself, coughed and
bridled like a girl, in the desire to accept flattery with becoming
deprecation and admission. And he would probably
soon after try to justify the compliment by referring admiringly
to something which he thought had the world’s stamp
of beauty upon it, quite possibly something which, but for
the stamp, would be odious to him.</p>

<p>He rarely talked even in his family on matters at all out
of the range of direct and material domestic interests, and in a
company where lively conversation was going on, would sit
silent and even answer questions unfrankly and with evident
discomfort. Yet though his communion with others was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
never wordy, a decided companionship was always necessary
to his comfort, and his silence was never churlish.</p>

<p>His sensitiveness to the beauty of nature was indeed
extraordinary, judging from the degree in which his habits
were affected by it; for he gave more time and thought to the
pursuit of this means of enjoyment than to all other luxuries,
and more than any man I have known who could not and
would not talk about it or in any way make a market of
it.</p>

<p>My mother died while I was so young that I have but a
tradition of memory rather than the faintest recollection of
her. While I was a small schoolboy if I was asked if I remembered
her I could say “Yes; I remember playing on the
grass and looking up at her while she sat sewing under a
tree.” I now only remember that I did so remember her, but
it has always been a delight to me to see a woman sitting
under a tree, sewing and minding a child.</p>

<p>My [step-]mother’s character was simpler than my
father’s, but she also had a strong love of nature and her
taste was more cultivated and had more of her own respect.</p>

<p>My father when a young man was fond of riding and
before I could be trusted alone on a horse was in the habit of
taking me sitting on a pillow before him. While still very
young I rode by his side.</p>

<p>The happiest recollections of my early life are the walks
and rides I had with my father and the drives with my
father and [step-]mother in the woods and fields. Sometimes
these were quite extended, and really tours in search of the
picturesque. Thus before I was twelve years old I had been
driven over the most charming roads of the Connecticut
Valley and its confluents, through the White Hills and along
most of the New England coast from the Kennebeck to the
Naugatuck. We were our own servants, my father seldom
fully trusting strangers in these journeys with the feeding,
cleaning or harnessing of his horses. We rested long in
pleasant places; and when at noon we took the nags out and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
fed them by the roadside, my father, brother and I would
often wander far looking for a bathing place and an addition
of fresh wild berries for the picnic dinner which my mother
would have set out in some well-selected shady place.</p>

<p>I had also before I was twelve traveled much with my
father and mother by stage coach, canal and steamboat,
visiting West Point, Trenton Falls, Niagara, Quebec, Lake
George.</p>

<p>I recollect less of any enjoyment I may then have had
than of my impression of the enjoyment my father and
mother constantly found in scenery. Yet they could have
talked little of it, both being of silent habits; and I am sure
that they did not analyze, compare and criticise.</p>

<p>These reflections rise naturally when I review the conditions
of my education, for although I was much separated
from my father and few men have less aptness, inclination or
ability than he had to give oral instruction, I see that the
unpremeditated and insensible influence which came to me
from him was probably the strongest element in my training.
I see also that my father may have unwittingly disclosed to
me more of his nature than to any one else. One of two or
three incidents that remain in my mind will show what I
mean. On a Sunday evening we were crossing the meadows
alone. I was tired and he had taken me in his arms. I soon
noticed that he was inattentive to my prattle and looking in
his face saw in it something unusual. Following the direction
of his eyes, I said: “Oh! there’s a star.” Then he said something
of Infinite Love with a tone and manner which really
moved me, chick that I was, so much that it has ever since
remained in my heart.</p>

<p>Brought up in a superstitious faith in preaching and
didactic instruction, and knowing how little he could by
deliberate purpose do for me in that way, my father’s affection
and desire to “do right by the boy” made him always
eager to devolve as much as practicable of the responsibility
of my education upon ministers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>I was placed successively in charge of six ministers.
That this was not a choice of schoolmasters appears from
the fact that while living with three of them I was, with my
father’s knowledge, sent out by them to day schools—twice
to the common school—and that only one himself gave me
regular instruction. In every case, too, I was for the most
part turned over for what is commonly called religious instruction
to Sunday school teachers,—that is to say, vain,
ignorant and conceited big boys and girls,—parrots or quacks
at the business.</p>

<p>The first of these ministers, who became my father by
deputy when I was but six years old, was the pastor of a
thoroughly rural parish. The surface of the country was
rugged, the soil, except in small patches, poor; the farms
consequently large and the settlement scattered; there was
one little general store at which the weekly mail was distributed;
there was no public house, but near the meetinghouse
some cabins had been built with fireplaces made of
field stone in which families who came from far could get
warm and eat their snack between the Sunday services. (I
think Sunday was then called Sunday and that the fashion
of calling it Sabbath came in afterwards or had not yet
reached this place.)</p>

<p>The accumulation of results of labor in several generations
was chiefly conspicuous in the stone walls which divided the
fields.</p>

<p>I suppose that the large family in which I lived, enjoyed
more luxury than any other, but I doubt if, one year with
another, four hundred dollars in money passed its hands.
Every household, however, was self-supporting and none so
needy that it would not resent an offer of gratuitous assistance
unless it were in such neighborly kindness as the poorest
might offer the richest. There was a single family of vagabond
habits who sometimes came to the store and bartered
small peltry chiefly for tobacco and rum, and once when they
had done so betook themselves to a Sunday house and shut<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
themselves up in it for a deliberate drunk. But even this
family which was distinguished and prayed for as “the poor”
kept up at least a profession of supporting themselves honestly.
They probably owned the cabin they lived in and a
small piece of mountain land about it. If not, I think they
were the only family that did not own some land and
till it.</p>

<p>Every one made long days’ work; the parson was diligent
and traveled far every week on his pastoral duties. He
worked with his own hands a little farm from which the
family living was helped out. He kept a horse and cow. He
entertained a good deal of company,—agents of benevolent
societies and traveling preachers as well as family friends,
parishioners and the families of neighboring ministers; but
he had no hired man servant and the only maid was a young
girl, probably a relative of his wife’s who often sat at the
table with us and before I left was married, perhaps to another
minister. There was another pupil, a big boy who was
reading Greek with the parson and who paid for his tutorship
by helping in the farm work. On the parson’s little farm we
had cows and swine and sheep, turkeys, geese, fowls and
bees. Besides the commoner farm crops, we raised flax and
spun it. We had an orchard and sent apples to a neighboring
cider mill. I remember seeing the parson grafting scions into
the trees. I remember also the beating a pan when the bees
swarmed, helping to pick the geese, helping to wash the sheep,
setting up the martin box, going with yarn to the weavers,
helping to make soap and to dip candles.</p>

<p>It seems to me that while I was here, though only six
years old, I was under no more constraint than a man; that
I went where I liked, did what I liked and, especially, that I
had a hand in everything that was going on in the neighborhood.
When I saw other boys going barefoot, I threw away
my shoes and was no more required to wear them except on
Sundays. Every house, every room, every barn and stable,
every shop, every road and highway, every field, orchard and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
garden was not only open to me but I was everywhere welcome.
With all their hard-working habits no one seemed to
begrudge a little time to make life happy to such a bothering
little chap as I must have been. Such a thing as my running
into danger even from bad company would seem not to have
been thought of.</p>

<p>I remember very distinctly wandering off by myself in
the evening to the store and sitting there listening to such
talk as happened; going to look in at the window of the Sunday
house to see the drunken poor folks; going with boys to
smoke out woodchucks from their burrows, to get rabbits in
winter out of stone walls, to trap mink in steel traps and
quail in figure-four traps. I remember going with rye to the
grist mill, riding on the sacks behind some man or bigger boy;
going at night to see a charcoal burning and then eating potatoes
baked in ashes. I am often reminded of the odor that
filled the air. Spending a day and night at a distant sugar
camp and then sleeping in a wigwam of bark. Making
pastoral visits to sick people with uncle,—so I called him
though he was no family relation. I remember when a man
came to say that a sick child was dead, and to get the key
of the meetinghouse. I went with him and saw him strike
three strokes on the iron triangle which hung suspended
by strips of cowhide from the beams of the belfry by which
the tidings were sent to all within hearing; and immediately
women began to come from all directions to show their sympathy
to the stricken parents. The loss of a single little child
stirred every heart in every household. We were dismissed
early from school next day and went to see the coffin
made.</p>

<p>I remember seeing the boards stained with a red wash and
varnished. We saw the grave dug and helped to take out
the bier and dingy pall from the little house in the graveyard
where they were kept. We walked in the funeral procession.
I remember the parson’s reading the usual notice in meeting
the next Sunday. “It having pleased God to remove by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
death the infant child of Reuben and Rebecca Wilson, the
afflicted parents, with the aged grandmother, the surviving
children and other relatives ask the prayers of the congregation
that this bereavement may be blessed to their spiritual
and eternal good.” As each class of the mourners was designated,
they stood up in their pew, and many of the women
looking on had tears in their eyes. I remember that I wondered
why uncle did not pray that the child should be raised
at once and brought back to her parents, and I tried it myself
when I went to bed.</p>

<p>I remember being taken up by a sleighing party and
driven far by moonlight to a large house where I saw flip
made by the kitchen fire; saw the parson’s girl drink it and
be merry; saw romping games played around the great chimney
and when finally I fell asleep, I was put to bed to be taken
home in the midst of a furious snowstorm in the bitter morning
by one of the boys who treated me to an upset in a snow-drift.</p>

<p>I don’t quite see how the people old and young—even
the drunkard—could be on such good terms with the parson
as it seems to me they were. I certainly have seen nothing
like it since. I think that the temperance reformation was
just beginning and my uncle preached and prayed in the
meeting, in the school and in the family against intemperance,
but total abstinence was not yet insisted on. The Anti-slavery
agitation had not arisen. Divisions on these two
questions I understand were afterwards so bitter that half
the congregation refused to come to meeting or to contribute
to the support of the minister, who finally was obliged to
ask for a dismissal on account of the extreme privations to
which his family became reduced.</p>

<p>I learned to read in a little brown schoolhouse on the
bank of a brook in the midst of the woods. I remember
chestnut, hemlock, birch and alder trees about it and near by
thickets of mountain laurel. The brook must have been a
small one for we made a pool by damming it, into which we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
put little trout and frogs that we caught with our hands, and
from which we filled the drink-water pail of the school.
The ground was strewn with rocks and the brook made a
crooked way among them with much babbling. I remember
beds of fragrant mint along its banks and of pennyroyal on
the drier roadside. Here too, by an old stone fence we
drew out sassafras roots and in a marshy place at the foot
of the hill we pulled the sweetflag root from the black
mire.</p>

<p>The narrow road passed on the other side of the schoolhouse
and sometimes, when wheels were heard approaching,
our mistress would stop short and cry: “Your elders are
coming. Make your manners! Make your manners!” and
we hastened to stand in line at the roadside, the boys to bow,
the girls to courtesy. Even when at play and out of sight
of the schoolhouse the boys would stop and take off their hats
if any much older person came near. We were eager to do
it, which perhaps is to be accounted for by the fact that we
saw so few people, and that no man would be in such haste or
so absorbed in other duties that he could not acknowledge the
courtesy and smile or say a pleasant word to us.</p>

<p>I was a favorite with the mistress. When she was married
and was starting for the Western Reserve in a chaise
with a horse-hide trunk, studded with brass nails, hung on
behind, she stopped at our house to see me. She cried a little
when she kissed me. Did I cry also? I think not.</p>

<p>I dimly recall much more that was quaint, and that it is
harder to believe in, of the habits and customs of the parish,
but I recall nothing that was not kindly or that I do not thoroughly
respect.</p>

<p>One of the most incredible of my recollections is that of
the serious and respectful interest taken by all classes of the
people in the annual spring parade of the militia, and first
that the drummer should have come to the parson for advice
as he did weeks beforehand in regard to the drum head. Its
renewal and the manner of it being determined, I went with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
squad to a distant currier’s where a sheep skin was selected,
bargained and paid for in seed potatoes. After it had been
prepared and mounted, the drummer and fifer practiced at
the store every night, Sundays excepted, until the day of the
muster.</p>

<p>On the Sunday before, some of the officers appeared
at meeting in partial uniform. It was questioned at dinner
whether this was a good custom; whether it did not minister
more to personal vanity than to any good. The parson, however,
regarded it as a suitable mark of respect to the
house of God and remarked that the military arm of the
republic had no strength except in its dependence on the
Almighty. The approaching occasion was remembered in
his prayers.</p>

<p>When the day came and the long roll was beaten in front
of the meetinghouse, about fifty true yeomen<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> fell in and
answered to their names. Nearly all wore parts of what had
once been uniforms. Very few were without a black and
red plume bound on the left side of their hats. The privates
all had muskets, but I have an impression that the non-commissioned
officers or some of them carried lances or halberds.
The commissioned officers were in full military suits,
not that these had been made to fit them, for I think that
they had been obtained for a consideration from their predecessors
and dated back to the last war. They had swords
and enormous <i>chapeau bras</i> with plumes and also wore leather
stocks and silk sashes. The company was drilled, marched,
counter-marched, dismissed for dinner, reassembled and,
at length, late in the day, a sergeant with a guard of honor
was sent to the parsonage and the minister escorted to the
ground. On his arrival he was duly saluted by the Company
which then formed in hollow square, the minister, commissioned
officers, “music” and the Company flag in the
centre. The minister delivered a short discourse, made a long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
prayer and, after being thanked by the Captain, was re-escorted
to the parsonage. There were few inhabitants of
the parish, old or young, who were not present at this ceremony,
as many as possible standing, men and boys with their
hats removed, on the long wooden steps of the meetinghouse
at the foot of which the square had been formed.</p>

<p>The Company being again brought into line the Captain
said a few words of compliment, closing nearly as
follows:</p>

<p>“You are now about to be dismissed for the day and I
hope that nothing will occur after the dismissal which will
lessen the respect which your exemplary conduct, while under
military discipline, has been calculated to inspire in the hearts
of the ladies. I will only add that after the dismissal I shall
give a treat at the north Sunday house which you are all
heartily invited to partake of.” Here a private stepped out
and called for three cheers for Captain Fowler, which were
given, the drum rolling and the flag waving.</p>

<p>In the Sunday house, pitchers, glasses, and plates of
crackers, cheese and gingerbread were set out and under their
influence, the earnestness which had so far characterized the
proceedings gave way to a certain temperate degree of hilarity,
forced and creaking.</p>

<p>After supper a drum and fife concert concluded the solemn
patriotic festival, the last piece performed being Old Hundred.</p>

<p>I do not know whether it was before or after this that I
spent several months with my uncle at Geneseo, where I
remember being taken to see Indians making baskets, to
visit at a house in the dooryard of which there was a fawn
and at which a beautiful woman gave me sweetmeats, and
that I was sometimes driven rapidly and silently over the
turf of the bottom lands among great trees.</p>

<p>I was for months again the smallest boy among sixty
at a boarding school, where I was placed under the special
care of another clergyman, of whom I remember nothing
after my father and mother drove away. Here I suffered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
in many cruel ways, and I still carry the scars of more than
one kind of the wounds I received. I was taken away suddenly
when one of the big boys wrote to his father, who sent
the letter to mine, that a teacher had lifted me up by my
ears and had so pinched one of them that it bled. My father
had not thought of taking me away when I wrote—I think
it must have been in my first letter to him—that there had
been a revival in the school; that I had experienced religion,
that I had had a prayer party in my bedroom to pray for his
conversion and that I wished him to read a certain tract, the
title of which I forget.</p>

<p>After this I lived for six months or more at home. But
home with me had many branches, for there were no less
than ten households of grandparents, granduncles and uncles
in which, for all that I recollect, I was as welcome and intimate
and as much at home as if I had been born to them.
My father’s grandfather had five sons, all of whom had, I
think, been seafaring men before the revolution. One had
sailed in a letter of marque, was taken prisoner and died in
the hulk at the Wallabout; another who was more successful
than the rest in acquiring wealth and honors was carried to a
peaceful grave before my day. Another was over ninety
years old when I was born. I dimly recollect him, living in a
large, rambling old farm house, of which he was the only occupant
except his housekeeper. The fourth was also over
ninety when I rode his knee. He had served the young
republic both on sea and land and was the hero of a very daring
and shrewd exploit, having, with three American seamen
and two negroes whom he compelled to assist him, recaptured
a valuable prize vessel on the high seas and brought her safely
in. They were all infirm from wounds and rheumatism and
I remember my grandfather out of his arm chair but once.
He then walked a little way with me in a warm spring day,
supporting himself with a long Malacca cane, which I now
own, held with both hands. Leaning against a fence he
pointed out a hang-bird’s nest in one of a row of elms near us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
and then told me that he had helped his father to plant the
trees, describing how small they were at the time. I wanted
my father to let me help him plant trees and he did, but they
were not placed with sufficient forecast and have since all
been cut down. But great-grandfather’s trees stand yet and
the hang-birds yet have their home in them.</p>

<p>Then I lived for a few months chiefly with my grandmother,
going irregularly to a village school, but being educated
more I think through some old novels, plays and books
of travels that I found in a sea chest in her garret. I actually
read at this time much of Zimmerman on <i>Solitude</i>, Sterne’s
<i>Sentimental Journey</i> and the <i>Vicar of Wakefield</i>. I have the
same volumes now, and I never have such a puzzling sense
of double life as when I see some of Coleman’s plays on the
stage.</p>

<p>I suppose these readings developed the talent which I
must have temporarily possessed two or three years later,
when I could hire other boys to do my chores by telling them
stories,—no doubt but partially of my own invention.</p>

<p>Then I spent nearly five years, vacations excepted, in the
home of a minister who undertook, with God’s help, to bring
up four select pupils in the fear of the Lord, making no distinction
between them and his own children. For their accommodation
he had bought and moved a small, old country
store alongside the parsonage proper, in the cellar of which he
stowed cabbages and roots, on the ground floor had a work-shop
and harness room, and in the second story the boys’
beds, desks and benches.</p>

<p>The clapboards were warped and shackling and the winter
pressed us hard. The heating apparatus was a sheet-iron
stove, if I am not mistaken made by the parson himself.
The parson’s salary was nominally $500 a year but the people
being poor and money scarce he took much of it in “produce”—firewood,
for instance, which was invariably delivered
when the sledding was good and mostly in logs. As
soon as winter came, the duty was put on me to keep up the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
fire one day in four, and to provide wood I had to cut and
split these logs, using a beetle and wedges for the larger ones;
then carry the wood to the school and up stairs—all in play-time—make
the fire before day and keep it up till bedtime.
I was eight years old and small of my age.</p>

<p>The parsonage had a small back kitchen in which there
was a wooden sink; outside the door stood an open water
butt with a spigot at the bottom. After we had dressed by
lamplight in the morning and perhaps broken a path through
the snow to “the other house,” we opened the back kitchen
door and in turn drew water in a cast-iron skillet about six
inches in diameter out of which with the aid of home-made
soft soap, held at a corner of the sink in a gourd, we washed
our hands and faces. A roller towel hung upon the wall for
the use of all the family. On Saturday night, hot water was
furnished us and we were expected to wash our ears, neck and
feet. Our meals were eaten in the kitchen and here, on the
bare floor, we twice a day kneeled in prayers.</p>

<p>The parson’s son, a weakly boy who afterwards died of
consumption, lived in the house with the family. The four
boarder boys had the “store” all to themselves except in
school hours.</p>

<p>They were kept in order in this way: At irregular intervals,
when they were expected to be studying their lessons,
the parson came to the foot of the stairs, took off his shoes,
crept softly up and stood with his ear at the latch. If there
was no disorder, he slipped down again and we perhaps knew
nothing of his visit. If I was telling a story—my stories were
generally of “run-aways”—the parson waited until I reached
a situation of interest, when he would break in shouting
“Oh! the depravity of human nature!” and seizing a ruler,
a stick of firewood or a broom handle, go at us all pellmell
over the head and shoulders.</p>

<h5 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE2">PREFACE</h5>


<p>Something accrues from special attention continuously
directed for many years to a particular field of observation
and reflection, giving a value to counsel about it that would
not be allowed on the ground of native talent or learning on
the part of the counsel-giver.</p>

<p>Partly for this reason I propose, by way of introduction,
to give at this point some account of my life.</p>

<p>But partly also I propose to do so from regard to a disposition
generally prevalent to underrate the value of professional
or bookish counsel on the subject of this book.
This disposition grows largely out of an impression that the
courses by which men come to set themselves up as professional
advisers on this subject or to write books upon it are,
like those of students in a school, of a kind to withdraw them
in a great degree from nature and from the ordinary life of
men, consequently from a ready, sympathetic understanding
of their wants; that these courses tend to pervert their natures,
lessen freedom of mind, restrain healthy impulses and
make them creatures of rules and conventions. This impression
is the deeper because of the influence unconsciously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
acting from an old idea associated with the word garden, the
essence of gardening having been withdrawal from nature
and restriction to artificial conditions. (<i>Garden</i>, <i>girdle</i> and
<i>girth</i> are from the same root—signifying constraint.) A
Gardener is thought of as a man working in accommodation
to artificial restrictions.</p>

<p>Many times something expressive of this idea has been
plainly said to me or possibly said of me and of my advice
and work. Hundreds of times a prejudice of mind of this
nature has been apparent in those seeking my counsel.</p>

<p>I hope the slight account I propose to give of myself may
cause what is to follow after it to be read with less prejudice
of this kind than it might otherwise be.</p>

<p>I can see that my pleasure began to be affected by conditions
of scenery at an early age,—long before it could have
been suspected by others from anything that I said and
before I began to mentally connect the cause and effect of
enjoyment in it. It occurred too, while I was but a half-grown
lad, that my parents thought well to let me wander as
few parents are willing their children should.</p>

<p>Within thirty miles of where they lived there were a score
of houses of their kindred and friends at which I was always
welcome. They were mostly farm houses and had near them
interesting rivers, brooks, meadows, rocks, woods or mountains,
those less rural had pleasant old gardens. Of the
people two only shall be referred to particularly. One a poor
scholar who, after a deep affliction, lived in seclusion with no
occupation but that of reading good old books to which he
had formed an attachment in happier days. One of his
favorite authors was Virgil, and he took pleasure in reading
and translating him to me. He was quaintly mild, courteous
and ceremonious, of musing, contemplative habits, and in
these and other respects so different from most men whom
I knew that, as he commanded my respect and affectionate
regard, I recognize him to have had a notable influence in my
education.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>The other had inherited a moderate competence and been
brought up to no regular calling. He lived in an unusually
fine old village house with an old garden, was given to natural
science, had a cabinet, a few works of art and a notable small
library. He was shy and absorbed and I took little from him
directly, but he was kind and not so careful of his treasures
that I could not cautiously use them as playthings and picture
books. He introduced me to Isaac Walton. He had no
man servant,—indeed no servants, his handmaids being of
the order then called help, and he was on precisely the terms
with them, as it now seems to me, that he might have been
with helpful sisters, though they did not sit at table with him.</p>

<p>A man came from without the household for the heavier
work of the place, giving but a small part of his time to it,
and there was a boy to do the light chores who received no
wages but worked for his board, books and schooling. One
of the boys who thus became my playfellow afterwards made
his way through college, studied law, and came to be a
member of Congress and Governor of a State.</p>

<p>For the rest my kinsmen and friends were plain, busy,
thrifty people, mostly farmers and good citizens.</p>

<p>If in my rambling habits I did not come home at night,
it was supposed that I had strayed to some of these other
homes where I would be well taken care of, and little concern
was felt at my absence; but it several times occurred before
I was twelve years old that I had been lost in woods and finding
my way out after sunset had passed the night with
strangers and had been encouraged by my father rather than
checked in the adventurousness that led me to do so.</p>

<p>It was my good fortune also at this period to be taken on
numerous journeys in company with people neither literary,
scientific nor artistic, but more than ordinarily susceptible
to beauty of scenery and who with little talking about it,
and none for my instruction, plainly shaped their courses and
their customs with reference to the enjoyment of it. As a
small boy I made four such journeys, each of a thousand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
miles or more, two behind my father’s horses, and two mostly
by stage coach and canal boat. Besides these many shorter
ones. When fourteen I was laid up by an extremely virulent
sumach poisoning, making me for some time partially blind,
after which, and possibly as a result, I was troubled for
several years with a disorder of the eyes, and the oculists
advised that I should be kept from study.</p>

<p>It followed that, at the time my schoolmates were entering
college, I was nominally the pupil of a topographical
engineer<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> but really for the most part given over to a decently
restrained vagabond life, generally pursued under the
guise of an angler, a fowler or a dabbler on the shallowest
shores of the deep sea of the natural sciences.</p>

<p>A hardly conscious exercise of reason in choosing where I
should rest and which way I should be going in these vagrancies,
a little musing upon the question what made for or
against my pleasure in them, led me along to a point at
which when by good chance the books fell in my way I was
sufficiently interested to get some understanding of what
such men as Price, Gilpin, Shenstone and Marshall thought
upon the subject.</p>

<p>Rural tastes at length led me to make myself a farmer.
I had several years of training on widely separated farms,
then bought a small farm for myself which I afterwards sold
in order to buy a larger, and upon this I lived ten years.
I was a good farmer and a good neighbor, served on the
school committee, improved the highways, was secretary of
a local farmer’s club and of the County Agricultural Society,
took prizes for the best crops of wheat and turnips and the
best assortment of fruits, imported an English machine, and
in partnership with a friend established the first cylindrical
drainage tile works in America.</p>

<p>But during this period also I managed to make several
long and numerous short journeys, generally paying my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
expenses by writing on rural topics for newspapers. As it
would have been an extravagance otherwise, however, I
first crossed the Atlantic in the steerage of a sailing vessel,
and nearly always traveled frugally. In all these tours I
took more interest than most travelers do in the arrangement
and aspect of homesteads and generally in what may be
called the sceneric character of what came before me.</p>

<p>The word <i>sceneric</i> flows from my pen unbidden and I
venture to let it stand. Some writers of late are using <i>scenic</i>
for the purpose it serves, but this is confusing, <i>scenic</i> having
been so long used with regard exclusively to affairs of the
drama.</p>

<p>All this time interest in certain modest practical applications
of what I was learning of the principles of landscape
architecture was growing with me,—applications, I mean, for
example, to the choice of a neighborhood, of the position
and aspect of a homestead, the placing, grouping and relationships
with the dwelling of barns, stables and minor outbuildings,
the planning of a laundry yard and of conveniences
for bringing in kitchen supplies and carrying away kitchen
wastes, for I had found that even in frontier log cabins a
good deal was lost or gained of pleasure according to the
ingenuity and judgment used in such matters; applications
also to the seemly position of a kitchen garden, of a working
garden for flowers to be cut for the indoor enjoyment of them,
to fixed outer floral and foliage decorations, to the determination
of lines of outlook and of in-look and the removal
or planting accordingly of trees, screens, hedges, windbreaks
and so on, with some consideration of unity of foreground,
middle ground and background, some consideration for
sceneric effect from without as well as from within the field
of actual operations. I planted several thousand trees on
my own land and thinned out and trimmed with my own
hand with reference to future pleasing effects a small body of
old woodland and another of well-grown copse wood.</p>

<p>Never the slightest thought till I was more than thirty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
years old had entered my mind of practicing landscape gardening
except as any fairly well-to-do, working farmer may,
and in flower gardening or of any kind of decorative or simply
ornamental gardening—any gardening other than such as I
have indicated—I was far from being an adept.</p>

<p>But I gradually came to be known among my neighbors
and friends as a man of some special knowledge, inventiveness
and judgment in such affairs as I have mentioned, and
to be called on for advice about them. At length, growing
out of such little repute, I was unexpectedly invited to take
a modest public duty and from this by promotions and
successive unpremeditated steps was later led to make
Landscape Architecture my calling in life....</p>

<p>I have since, partly on professional and partly on other
occasions, continued to travel a great deal.... But a
small part of my journeyings either in the old or the new
world have been made by railways. I have traveled several
thousand miles on foot and several thousand in the saddle
and I have had rare opportunities for seeing people of all
sorts in all parts of our land in their homes.</p>

<p>All the time interest in scenery, landscape, landscape
architecture, has been strong with me.</p>

<p>Through these causes and because of the interest I have
thus explained I have been much led into pointed conversations
with men and women under a great variety of circumstances,
while looking about their abodes or while following
their chosen paths, roads and waters, with regard to the
pleasure to be had in doing so and with direct reference to
means of enhancing it or getting the better of circumstances
restricting it.</p>

<p>In connection with the tours for the enjoyment of scenery
which young Frederick Olmsted made, generally with his
parents, it is perhaps interesting to record in detail one taken
in 1838, when he was sixteen. His father, Mr. John Olmsted,
kept an accurate diary, and in this we find noted: “Journey
to White Mountains,” “in our double carriage,” “self, wife,
Fredk. and John,” Aug. 8-25, 1838. The itinerary reads:</p>

<p>“Springfield, Mt. Holyoke, Northampton, Whateley,
Deerfield (old houses), Bloody Brook, Greenfield, Bernardstown,
Brattleboro, Putney Hills, Walpole, Bellows Falls,
Charleston, Claremont, Windsor, Hanover (view of river
from hill), Orford, Haverhill (N. H.), Newbury (Vt.), Oxbow
Narrows, Bath, Franconia Notch, Mt. Lafayette, Littleton,
Fabyan, Crawford Notch, Conway, Center Harbor, Lake
Winnipesaukee, Red Mt., Wolfboro, Rochester, Great Falls,
Dover, Portsmouth, Newburyport, Haverhill, Andover,
Lynn, Nahant, Boston.”</p>

<p>In Boston there is a note: “Navy Yard, Bunker Hill,
Mt. Auburn, Athenæum,” Aug. 22 “F. to Andover.”</p>

<p>Frederick’s voyage to China before the mast in 1843
gave little opportunity for pleasure sightseeing, and while
lying in the ports of Canton and Hongkong,—if we may judge
from the few notes he has left about this experience,—he
was naturally most interested in the people and their strange
customs and their attitude towards “heathen” visitors.</p>

<p>There are two of Frederick’s letters relating to trips in
the summer of 1845.</p>

at Charlotte. The afternoon’s ride of that day was through
a very poor country, clay and stones. What land had been
cleared seemed to be principally devoted to the raising of
burnt stumps and mullen; some little grass, to be sure did
now and then make its appearance, but I should think the
poor sheep would find it hard work enough to live, without
troubling themselves with growing wool. A little ways out
of Charlotte, though, I recollect I was met by one of the
finest views I had ever seen. It was on a hill which overlooked
the country and the lake towards the southwest.
Between me and the Lake lay some pretty village or other
on the ground sloping towards it, the land looking really
very rich,—and by the way the soil just by the lake all along
is fine. Beyond lay the Lake itself,—bays, islands, etc.,—looking
beautifully; but the chief charm was the background,
a heap of mountains over in Essex Co. I never saw mountains
rise more beautifully one above another, the larger
ones seeming to cluster round and protect the smaller, nor
did the summer veil of haze ever sit on them more sweetly.
Back of all rose some magnificent thunder-heads and they
rose fast too, compelling me at five o’clock to take refuge
and toast and eggs in a little road-side inn.</p>

<p>Charley and I had a fine cruise ’round. Charley wanted
to get home before Emma left, and we drove, with all night<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
sleeping in a boat or on the ground, and one night on a sloop’s
transom. Sunday night we camped out at Haddam, below.
Made a sq. sail of our tent, and turned in on a blanket under
it. It was a most beautiful place, a green grassy dell glen
sloping gently up, lofty and picturesque trees opening a way
for it back to a most lovely vista. A most charming prospect
of our Rhine in front and on either side. Lots of wild pigeons,
meteors, owls, sturgeons, mosquitoes, wipporwills, methodists,
and hydrophious quadrupeds to lull us to grassy sleep.
We struck our tent and broke up camp at an hour or two
before day break, and were till noon working up to the landing
a few miles above. I believe you will think we didn’t do
much at Mineralogizing. We went with John and Rev.
Mr. Gilbert to the mines—a rocky hillside, and in an hour or
two got a pocket full of tourmalines, garnites and something
else (?) and appetites and a glass of brandy for my cholic,
because we were too lazy to kindle a fire Sunday morning
and eat green apples to kill-hunger....</p>

<p>Both Frederick Olmsted and his brother were fond of
boating, and, in their small sail-boat, had many trips on the
Connecticut River and in the Sound, especially during the
family’s summer visits to Sachem’s Head. In spite of the
harshness of his experiences on the Chinese voyage, Mr.
Olmsted retained his fondness for ships and was wont to
hold up the clipper ship as the ideal of beauty in perfect
organization for use.</p>

<p>There is also a reminiscence jotted down in Mr. Olmsted’s
later days of a trip to Canada in 1846.</p>

<p>Once on a time my father took me with him on a journey
which carried us into Canada. While there we had for several
days as a traveling companion an Englishman, animated,
amiable, frank and engaging. As I think of our intercourse
now, I can see plainly that he looked upon me as a new specimen
and was drawing me out and turning me over with the
interest of a naturalist. It is clear also that he got some new
ideas from me and often when our conversation was interrupted,
he took notes. My experience with men in America,
though I was a youngster, had been various, and I was then
fresh from association with a large number of youngsters,—youngsters
merely, but gathered from all parts of the Union.
With these I had been made intimate at foot ball and boat
club, in long walks, trouting excursions, duck shooting, long
winter night talks over the stove and more formal debates
of our “Society.” My experience of mankind and my views
of men were crude and bigoted, but they were obviously
sincere and simple convictions and they were as strange to
the Englishman as average English country-gentlemen’s
convictions would surely be to me.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">[5]</a> This letter, written to one of his chums, refers to a sailboat trip from New
Haven to Hartford, with Charles Loring Brace, another of the group of five
young men formed during the New Haven days (John Hull and F. L. Olmsted,
Charles Trask, and the two just mentioned). In a reminiscent letter Frederick
Olmsted says of Charles Brace: “We had many long tramps together; I
remember once being with him for a week or two on a walk which took us
through Litchfield, Stockbridge and Lenox. I remember also vividly a fine
run of fourteen miles on skates, ending in a cold bath. He entered college
with my brother and they were room-mates; and, as for four years afterwards
I lived in or near New Haven, and was, a part of the time, attending the same
lectures with them, we continued to be in close intimacy.”</p>

<p>Again in the nineties, when Mr. Olmsted was thinking
over and analyzing his early experiences in their effect on his
subsequent professional work, there is a letter to an old
friend, a lady, which shows especially his turn of mind in
youth and some of his self-chosen readings:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I am thinking that of all the young men you know, I was
the least likely to do what I have, and that you cannot know
or guess in what way I was led to it. Nor can you know
what is most prominently in my mind when I refer to these
doings. I need not conceal from you that I am sure that the
result of what I have done is to be of much more consequence
than any one else but myself supposes. As I travel, I see
traces of influences spreading from it that no one else would
detect, which if given any attention by others, would be
attributed to “fashion.” There are, scattered through the
country, seventeen large public parks, many more smaller
ones, many more public or semi-public works, upon which,
with sympathetic partners or pupils, I have been engaged.
After we have left them, they have, in the majority of cases,
been more or less barbarously treated, yet as they stand,
with perhaps a single exception, they are a hundred years
ahead of any spontaneous public demand, or of the demand
of any notable cultivated part of the people. And they are
having an educative effect perfectly manifest to me—a
manifestly civilizing effect. I see much indirect and unconscious
following of them. It is strange how often I am
asked: “Where did you get that idea?” as if an original idea<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
on the subject had not been expected. But I see in new works
of late much evidence of effects of invention—comprehensive
design; not always happy, but symptomatically pleasing.
Then I know that I shall have helped to educate in a good
American school a capital body of young men for my profession,—all
men of liberal education and cultivated minds.
I know that in the minds of a large body of men of influence
I have raised my calling from the rank of a trade, even of a
handicraft, to that of a liberal profession, an art, an art of
design. I have been resolute in insisting that I am not to be
dealt with as a mere agent of my clients, but as a councillor,
a trustee, <i>on honor</i>. I have always refused to take employment
on other terms, and when it has appeared that I must
do so or yield the point, I have seven times already resigned
the charge of important and interesting works. It is what I
have done in these respects, and what I see of the indirect
effect on the standing of my profession and the progress of
my art, that leads me to write to you after so many years,
in the self-complacent way that I do. This, rather than
anything you have seen, or of which you have read.</p>

<p>I was saying that of the young men, comradic young men,
that you knew, I was the last to have been expected to lead
such a life as I have. I was strangely uneducated,—mis-educated.
Because of an accident putting my eyes in some
peril, I was at the most important age left to “run wild,”
and when at school, mostly as a private pupil in families of
country parsons of small, poor parishes, it seems to me that
I was chiefly taught how not to study,—how not to think
for myself. I tried to learn Euclid by rote, without trying
to understand what it meant. While my mates were fitting
for college, I was allowed to indulge my strong natural
propensity for roaming afield and day dreaming under a
tree. The year before John entered college, I went to sea
before the mast. It was soon after my return from China
that I first met you and you lifted me a good deal out of my
constitutional shyness and helped more than you can think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
to rouse a sort of scatter-brained pride and to make me
realize that my secluded life, country breeding, and mis-education
were not such bars to an “intellectual life” as I
was in the habit of supposing. Or, if this is too personal, let
me say that, through visiting at your house the first winter
I was at New Haven with John, I was given a turn, not to
study, but toward an “intellectual life” to which I feel that
nearly all that I have been saying complacently of my doings
is to be remotely attributed. You will smile of my thinking
of you at all as a mentor, especially in a literary way, if you
remember a certain Christmas present that you gave me:
(It was burned thirty years afterwards with some heirlooms,
autograph letters of Washington and Webster and other
treasures). But in some way in which you had to do, I was
led up at that time to Emerson, Lowell and Ruskin, and
other real prophets who have been familiar friends ever
since. (Here they are on my bed-table). And these gave me
the needed respect for my own constitutional tastes and an
inclination to poetical refinement in the cultivation of them
that afterwards determined my profession. Yet that is not
quite fair, for I had had two lifts in the same direction before.
One, when I had heard my father reading the books of travel
in New England of President Dwight, Professor Silliman and
Miss Martineau, in all of which the observations on scenery
with which I was familiar had helped to make me think that
the love of nature, not simply as a naturalist but as a poet
loves it, was respectable. The other, when, yet a boy, I
found in the Hartford Public Library certain books, which it
is a strange thing that I should have looked into; stranger
that I should have assimilated as much as, when re-reading
them perhaps twenty years afterwards, I found that I had.
They were Price on the <i>Picturesque</i> and Gilpin on <i>Forest
Scenery</i>,—books of the last century, but which I esteem so
much more than any published since, as stimulating the
exercise of judgment in matters of my art, that I put them
into the hands of my pupils as soon as they come into our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
office, saying, “You are to read these seriously, as a student
of law would read Blackstone.”</p>
</div>

<p>Of Mr. Olmsted’s early reading we have several accounts
in letters written at the time.</p>

<p>There is a letter to Fred. Kingsbury in which Fred. Olmsted
enumerates “Books to Read.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Moral Philos</span>: “Butler’s Sermons,” (recommended by
Dr. Chalmers, Sir James Mackintosh, Arnold, Pycroft and
others). In place of it, “Sewell’s Chstn. Morals”; “Abercrombie’s
Philos. of Moral Feeling” (brief and comprehensive);
“Foster’s Essay on Decision of Character.” <span class="smcap">Mental
Philos</span>: “Abercrombie on the Intellectual Powers, and the
Investigation of Truth”; “Combe’s Constitution.” <span class="smcap">Political
Philos</span>: “Miss Martineau’s Tales,” (I suppose they are
to Polit. Philos. similar to Historic Novels to History);
“Whately” [Richard]; “M’Culloch’s Principles”; “The
Encyclopedia” (Rent, tax, etc.); “Jefferson”; “The Federalist,
etc.”; <span class="smcap">Art</span>: “Abstract of Sir Josh. Reynolds’ discourses”;
“Abstract of Pilkington’s Lives of Painters”—(Visit collection
in compy. with an artist); “Allan Cunningham’s British
Painters”—Sculpture—Encyclopedia. <span class="smcap">British History</span>:
“Socy. for Prom. Chstn. Knowledge”; “Miller’s Life of
George III”; “Lives of George IV and Wm. IV”; “History
of British India”; “Basil Hall”; “Macaulay.”</p>

<p>I say nothing about Poetry or Fiction or Ecclesiastical
Literature. I’ve read enough already to choose from to read
over again without going wrong, and I presume I can read
back to better advantage than I can read ahead. I say
nothing either about Agriculture or Law—I have a course
in each laid out. I expect to read on Geology, Mineralogy,
and Anatomy before long and Nat’l History generally as I
have opportunity or inclination.</p>

<p>I’ll thank you to give me any advice suggested to you in
reading the above. I have left out “Cobbett’s Grammar,”
“Whately’s Rhetoric and Logic.” I have read “Burke on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
Taste” and your Rept. of Prof. Lardner’s Lecture. I should
like to find more of those comprehensive Lectures on such
subjects. Prof. Lardner’s Lectures are brief and comprehensive
and very well adapted to give a simple man a common
information in regard to Natural Science and Mechanics.
You must have been bored with this letter but I expect you
to answer it becomingly.</p>
</div>

<p>It must have been earlier than this that he attended with
Charles Brace “a private course of lectures on architecture.”</p>

<p>From 1845, Mr. Olmsted’s main study centered in agriculture.
From “Fairmount,” Mr. Geddes’s farm, he wrote
to his father June 16, 1846: “<i>Farmer’s Lib.</i> &amp;c I received
Monday. I am glad they are going to publish the <i>Book of
the Farm</i> next. I had hoped they would. It is a cheap way
of getting it. English price is I think $20.”</p>

<p>Again on Aug. 12, 1846, he wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have been looking for a letter from you and the <i>Monthly
Journal</i> for two or three days. I am anxious to hear about
the Head Farm. If the <i>Farmer’s Library</i> can be had separately
at half subscription price, I would drop the <i>Monthly
Journal</i> though it is very good, in favor of Drs. Emmons and
Prime’s <i>Quarterly Journal of Agriculture and Science</i>, a very
able, practical, scientific, periodical, $1.50.</p>

<p>I have thought of writing an article about Fuller’s
Farming, etc. for the <i>Cultivator</i>, but have given it up because
I have not myself sufficient reliance on the correctness of
statements.</p>
</div>

<p>The same year he wrote to Fred. Kingsbury: “I am reading
now everything on Horticulture and Pears and Arnold’s
life and correspondence—I always loved Arnold—and pears.”</p>

<p>From Guilford, Connecticut, February 16, 1847, Frederick
wrote his brother John: “Tell Father I want the <i>Horticulturist</i>,
etc. Nothing here but the <i>Boston Cultivator</i>.”</p>

<p>On a visit to New York City in October, 1847, he mentioned
spending a forenoon “at Colman’s,” who has “a
beautiful new portfolio of sketches in Holland and Belgium,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
mostly interiors. They are very fine” ... “lots of fine
things of course—two finer than I ever saw of Landseer”
... “I bought a number of books, cheaply at the auctions.”</p>

<p>After his father purchased for him the farm on Staten
Island, he began to think of a rounded-out collection of his
own. We find him writing to his brother: “There are a lot
of books that are essential to even a common library—or a
country tavern parlor—that I have not got. Such buy if you
can, without fail.”</p>

<p>The young farmer thought also of decorating his walls,
and wrote to his father about pictures (March 9, 1848):
“You said I could have a lot out of the portfolios; I should be
exceedingly glad if you could spare me some frames.” The
“portfolios” doubtless included the one which Mr. Olmsted
referred to later in life in a reminiscent jotting:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The first portfolio of prints that I ever saw was a possession
of my childhood and was a series of views of English park
scenery. Chance soon after put in my hand Gilpin’s <i>Forest
Scenery</i> and Gilpin’s and Marshall’s <i>Tours</i> and criticisms of
parks. I have been studying the subject ever since.</p>
</div>

<p>In February, 1849, Frederick mentioned in a letter to
his brother John that he had been reading and discussing
<i>Modern Painters</i>, for which he always continued to have a
high regard. Later in the month he referred to one of the
subjects in which he was then principally interested as
“Landscape Beauty and the Beauty of all Nature.” His
tastes were varied, for he mentioned also several other
miscellaneous subjects including the “Theory of Language”
and the “Theory, Economy, etc. of Love.”</p>

<p>On his English tour in 1850 he acquired a number of
works on agriculture and gardening, of which unfortunately
we have no specific record; and after his return he wrote over
to one of his travelling companions Charles Brace, still
abroad: “I want you to get or order in London in addition
to what I asked previously: <i>Morton on Soils</i> (up to $2.),
<i>Hutchinson on Spring Draining</i> (not over $2.), <i>Hewit Davis
on Thin Sowing</i> (a pamphlet), Prof Johnstone’s <i>Tables of
Experiments in Agriculture</i> (a pamphlet, very important).”</p>

<p>Mr. Olmsted’s own book <i>Walks and Talks</i> came out in
1852. On a bill (1852) from G. P. Putnam &amp; Co., Publishers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
and Importers, including several copies of <i>Walks and Talks</i>
evidently purchased for gifts, are listed also: “1 Pencil
Sketches,” “1 Smith’s Parks and Pleasure Grounds,” “1
Am. Farmer,” “1 Caird’s Agriculture,” “1 Miniature Fruit
Garden,” and “1 Agricultural Survey.”</p>

<p>It is a great pity that the library collected by Mr. Olmsted
during his career as a farmer and later as a writer, and
during the first years of his work as a landscape architect,
was practically all burned in the winter of 1863-64 after his
departure for California. Regarding this calamity, he wrote
a friend:</p>

<p>“Since I left New York all my household goods including
a library with a number of rare technical books which I got
in Europe and can never replace have been destroyed by
fire.”</p>

<p>The books were stored at the Staten Island farm in an
outbuilding, thought to have been maliciously fired.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br><span class="small">FARMING</span></h3></div>


<p>Following his taste for outdoor life, and with the approval
of his father, Frederick Olmsted determined to become
a farmer at the time his brother was determining on a
doctor’s career if his health permitted. It was through their
friend Frederick Kingsbury that Frederick Olmsted was
directed to the farm of Mr. Joseph Welton in Waterbury,
where he began the serious study of agriculture in May, 1845.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>In June of that year he wrote to Charles Brace from
Waterbury:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>For myself I have every reason to be satisfied with my
prospects. I grow more contented or more fond of my business
every day,—really, for a man that has any inclination
for agriculture, the occupation is very interesting, and if you
look closely you will be surprised to see how much honorable
attention and investigation is being connected with it. The
<i>Cultivator</i> has now five regular monthly European correspondents.
Scientific men of highest distinction are there
devoting their undivided attention to its advance; and I
think here, the coming year will show a remarkable progress.</p>
</div>

<p>A day or two later Frederick wrote his brother John:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>For my part I believe that our farmers are, and have
cause to be, the most contented men in the world; and for
the matter of profit, it is sufficient to know that they live and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
bring up their families in what they consider comfortable
circumstances, with the usual system and management. I
should think by the use of the proper tools and machinery
which a man of intelligence and information could procure
and invent, at least half of the most disagreeable and hard
labor of our old-fashioned farmers might be dispensed with
to advantage. But I doubt whether taste for its peculiar
pleasures, or inclination or ability for its manual exertions,
will make you a farmer. If you could, however,—and of this
you are the best judge,—become interested in its operations
for a year or two, and connect yourself with its present rapid
advance as an honorable and learned profession, you would
not only find it a sufficient means of support, but an agreeable
and healthful pursuit.</p>
</div>

<p>From notices in farm journals, such as the <i>Cultivator</i>,
Frederick Olmsted was led to select the farm of Mr. George
Geddes called “Fairmount,” near Owego, N. Y., as the place
to pursue further his apprenticeship in agriculture, since Mr.
Geddes<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> had been awarded first prize for the best-ordered
farm in New York State.</p>

<p>On March 19, 1846, Frederick wrote to his brother from
Hartford:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I shall start I think directly after the election, I presume
going to Albany first, and then on west to Syracuse, etc.,
with letters from Mr. Norton and Tucker of the <i>Cultivator</i>.
Father has obtained 15 new subscribers for the <i>Cultivator</i>
here.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Perhaps, and I should prefer to, come per New Haven
and N. Y. and first with Professor O’s letter to Owego.
Please do say what you think about it. I should like to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
you a visit again before I go for good and I shall probably
spend next winter on [the] farm.</p>
</div>

<p>In June he wrote to Frederick Kingsbury from “Fairmount”:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I want to make myself useful in the world, to make others
happy, to help to advance the condition of Society, and
hasten the preparation for the Millennium, as well as other
things too numerous to mention.</p>

<p>Now, how shall I prepare myself to exercise the greatest
and best influence in the situation of life I am likely to be
placed in. You know perhaps as well as I what that is—I
suppose it’s not very great stretch of ambition to anticipate
my being a Country Squire in Old Connecticut in the course
of fifteen years. I should like to help then as far as I could
[to foster] in the popular mind generosity, charity, taste and
etc.,—independence of thought of voting and of acting.
The education of the <i>ignoble vulgus</i> ought to be much improved
and extended.</p>

<p>The Agricultural Interest greatly preponderates in
number and wealth in the state, but perhaps has the least
influence in Legislation. Lawyers whose sense of right and
truth is blunted by profession—the sense of law—and
traffickers who value themselves as they can make their own
interest appear—whether truly or not—the interest of
another, make our laws, make public opinion, because they
have had their intellectual faculties sharpened by practice
and education. Now the people-farmers and mechanics—the
producing classes that the rest live on—want to think and
judge for themselves, to cultivate the intellectual.</p>
</div>

<p>There is happily a reminiscence written by Mrs. Frederick
Law Olmsted in 1920<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> of her husband’s establishment on his
own farm at Staten Island and of the meeting of the Olmsted
and Perkins families.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In the summer of 1847 Mr. John Olmsted of Hartford,
Conn., was staying, with his family, at the Sachem’s Head
Hotel where he met Mr. John Bowne of New York. Mr.
Bowne’s wife was the daughter of Dr. Akerly late of Staten
Island, whose family were desirous of selling the farm left
by Dr. Akerly. Mr. Olmsted and his son Frederick, being
dissatisfied with the prospect for success in the small farm at
Guilford, bought not long before for Frederick, accepted Mr.
Bowne’s invitation to go to Staten Island, South Side, and
inspect the Akerly farm. Their impression was so favorable
that Mr. Olmsted bought the place, 130 acres, paying for it
$12,000.00 and took possession the following winter. The
farm stretched from the Main Road to the shore of Prince’s
Bay about a mile in length.</p>

<p>“Leaving the main road one entered a very pretty wood
of trees of fair size,—oaks, maples, sweet and sour gum,
sassafras, holly, etc. After about a quarter of a mile one
came out upon the cleared land on the top of a small rise.
The soil was heavy red clay, very suitable for wheat, etc.,
yielding up to 40 bushels per acre. There was a sort of
plateau from which the land sloped gently down for about
quarter of a mile and then an almost level stretch went to
the bank six feet above the beach. From all this part of the
farm there was a fine view of Prince’s Bay looking across
to Sandy Hook (slightly foreshortened), Navesink, and the
New Jersey Hills stretching away to the southward. There
were no trees on this level with the exception of one tall old
pear tree at the foot of which were found from time to time
the bones of the slaves who had been buried there....</p>

<p>“The farm commanded a view of all shipping outward
or inward bound....</p>

<p>“The house, standing at the foot of the slope, was built
of rough stone plastered over with lime, and had been, until
shortly before Dr. Akerly’s death, only a story and a half
high. He had, in order to accommodate his growing family
of grand-children built on in wood a full story and a half,
giving nine bed chambers. Outside the junction of the stone
and wood was disguised by the roof of an all round piazza.
Inside the effect was rather odd for the stone wall a foot and
a half thick came up nearly three feet and on top of it were
built closets convenient, but queer. Downstairs was an
entrance hall of 12 × 16 feet going through from east to west
and on each side a 16 ft. square room with tolerably high<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
ceiling, windows with deep seats looking east and in one
room a window looking south either side of the fireplace.</p>

<p>“On the south end, the ground sloped so that there was
an easy entrance for barrows to the cellar, large and well
lighted, and used as a dairy. There was a small outbuilding
north of the house where was found a breast plate engraved
‘The King’s American Dragoon’s,’ laid away on a beam in
what had evidently been a stable.</p>

<p>“The first time I ever saw Frederick was in February of
1848 when he came over to Holly Hill to tell Grandpa Perkins
the news of the flight of Louis Philippe from Paris, just
received in New York.</p>

<p>“Frederick was then settled on his farm with his Aunt
Maria Olmsted as housekeeper and provider for two jolly
green freshly imported Irish maids and three or four farm
laborers. We soon called on her and the families were very
friendly. At that time Grandpa occupied Holly Hill Farm
and Uncle Frank was living in South Brooklyn. John Hull
Olmsted had just graduated and had come to New York
to Dr. Willard Parker’s office to study medicine. He came
to the farm for week ends and holidays bringing Charles
Brace generally and sometimes Frederick Kingsbury. By
the winter time I had grown so intimate with the Olmsteds
that it was arranged that I should pass Christmas at Hartford
on my way back from a visit in Boston, which I did.</p>

<p>“In June his father, step-mother and half sisters Mary
and Bertha and young half brother Albert came to pass a
long season, bringing with them a fine span of horses and an
open carriage, the regular farm outfit being Old Black subject
to blind staggers and not too speedy at best and an old
Rockaway.</p>

<p>“Frederick was at this time 26 years of age full of life and
fun. He threw himself into farming with enthusiasm, introduced
system and order to his men, expecting for one
thing that at knocking off time every tool used should be
returned to its appointed place and that every ‘chore’ should
be done at the hour fixed, the foreman to report progress
before going in to supper. He engaged in planting and dealing
in fruit-trees, pears principally, which he imported from
France. All was done in a simple inexpensive way, using the
old buildings on the place and practicing rigid economy. He
interested himself in the County Agricultural Society and
soon became an active member in company with Wm. H.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
Vanderbilt who was at the time a farmer at New Dorp
Lane.</p>

<p>“Frederick had a very pretty talent for caricatures, not
of a grotesque kind but full of quiet humor.... He was
fond of long discussions on moral points as when, if ever, it is
allowable to depart from a direct statement of fact, etc., etc.
He was perhaps over fond of arguments to be pleasing to
women. Whimsies had no charm for him. <i>Sartor Resartus</i>
and <i>Modern Painters</i> were our text books.</p>

<p>“Aunt Maria was a dear kind devoted woman of fifty,
plain as a pikestaff and devoid of vanity.</p>

<p>“Mr. Olmsted, the father, had just retired from business
with a modest competence. He was the kindest and most
indulgent of fathers,—a man with a strict sense of justice
and of duty, exacting toward himself rather than toward
others. His wife was a Puritan, a model of order and system,
most efficient as an organizer and full of interest in Nature
and Man.</p>

<p>“The family continued to make its summer home at the
farm until the end of the summer of 1853, six years.”</p>
</div>

<p>It was in 1849-1850 that Frederick considered going into
the nursery business on a small scale. He wrote to his father
on March 14:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have been to Flushing and got the trees. Parsons’ bill
is $258. and he desires especially if it cannot be paid before
the 1st of May that he may have paper that he can use—your
note. I have been so unfortunate in my sales that I concluded
not to take so many by 300 trees as I had intended.
Parsons being very willing, he will probably sell the trees
from 5 to 10 per cent more than my price. Mr. Field strongly
recommends me to purchase for myself in France. Thinks I
might find ready sale for some thousand on Staten Island
within a few years, at 100 per cent over cost of importing
them. I called at the Packet offices this morning but could
not get anything reliable as to freight. As near as I can guess
the bulk of 100 trees (small dwarf pear) of ordinary goods
would not be over $1.00. S—— gave me to understand it
would be near $10. I think he lied. But even at that I could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
import them one year younger than these I have of Parsons
for but little more than one half what I pay him and at about
one quarter what Mr. Field paid for his.</p>
</div>

<p>Later in his venture he wrote to Fred Kingsbury:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">South Side</span>, Dec. 21, 1850.<br>
</p>

<p>There is a good deal of building this winter.</p>

<p>My trees are to arrive soon, so I cannot go to Connecticut
at present. More of them than I had calculated the man
could supply, about 5,000 pears. The nurseryman makes
me a present of 200 samples of his shrubs and trees. They
are also lower than they had been offered and promise very
fine. You have a nurseryman in Waterbury. I wish you
would ask him if he does not want some pears on pear or
quince stock, of the latter I have the finest lot ever imported
and will sell them lower than the regular nurserymen. I
shall have a few popular shrubs and trees of other sorts. How
would a few hundred go at auction in Waterbury? I have a
lot of (pot plants) cedar of Lebanon.</p>
</div>

<p>In this letter, he adds:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We are likely to have a Plank Road upon the island,
contract is offered at exactly the sum per mile I estimated
in an article upon the subject in the <i>Staten Isler</i> last spring.
Our society does well, I have near $20. worth of premiums.</p>
</div>

<p>The society to which he refers, and of which he was
Corresponding Secretary, was the Richmond County Agricultural
Society. Early in 1850 the Board of Managers
issued an “Appeal to the Citizens of Staten Island.” In this
we read:</p>

<p>“How is this, Fellow Citizens? Is the very best method
of Farming which can be adopted universally practiced
among us? Is it by any one of us? Is Agriculture, as a
science, sufficiently understood in our community? Can no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
luxuries be added to our orchards—no new beauty bloom in
our gardens? Are there no incongruities or inconveniences in
our Domestic Architecture? Is the want of refined Rural
Taste nowhere observable on our island? Are we quite
satisfied with our <i>Roads</i>—confident that our breeds of cattle
are unsurpassed, and that no improvements can be added
to the implements of our Husbandry, that we should neglect
or refuse to combine our knowledge and influence in these
matters? May we not want a little of the patriotic sentiment,
the neighborly feeling, the cordial good understanding among
ourselves, that would be promoted by a free interchange of
our thoughts, opinions and observations, and by manifesting
a unity of purpose with regard to these subjects of common
interest?”</p>

<p>Frederick recorded his progress in the nursery business
in a letter to his father Nov. 6, 1851:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have sold near $100. worth of trees besides those sent
to Terry. Received order for a small lot to be delivered at
Hartford at wholesale prices from Sol. Porter, Porter Place,
Banker. I referred him to my letter but told him that on the
supposition that he meant to increase his order I would send
the trees, putting them on board Hartford boat at $50. rate,
if I did not hear from him this week to the contrary. He
ordered also some peach trees, which I shall have to get, I
don’t know where. Next day another order, “2d, not for
Porter Place,” for 20 more pears. I have had two calls from
men that wanted a large number shade trees—evergreens—and
other fruit trees, that I could not supply—and could not
get the ordering of. One of them<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> is engaged in laying out
grounds for Aspinwalls, Livingston and others at Clifton
and told me he should have bought a good many hundred
trees if I had had such as he wanted. He took 31 pears at 60
cts. for Livingston and O’Conner. Townsend called &amp; took
24, Bunker, 15 and others of that sort, making the best sort
of nest eggs for the business.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>
<p>There is a remark in a letter of 1890 from Mr. Olmsted
to Dr. Peter Collier, Director of the Agricultural Experiment
Station at Geneva, N. Y., which shows how important he
considered this period of his career: “I began life as a farmer,
and although for forty years I have had no time to give to
agricultural affairs, I still feel myself to belong to the farming
community, and that all else that I am has grown from the
agricultural trunk.”</p>

<p>There are several bits in the letters during his career
as a farmer that show his earliest attempts at landscape
improvement.</p>

<p>When the farm at Sachem’s Head, Guilford, was being
considered for purchase, he wrote to his father, July 23, 1846:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have thought a good deal about that Sachem’s Head
place without knowing it was for sale (so I have of ’Miah’s).
There is no fruit there, I suppose, and perhaps no soil for it.
I should like to hear more about it. There is the prettiest
ground for a <i>ferme ornée</i> in that place of ’Miah’s I ever saw
almost, a beautiful nook under the mountain or dell, with a
fine large trout brook running through it, a quarter of a mile
from David’s, half a mile from the railroad canal. The farm
has been miserably cultivated by the old miserly tyrant that
has gone to his account, but there is by nature excellent land
and every convenience and beauty desirable.</p>
</div>

<p>After the Sachem’s Head farm was bought, he wrote
definitely (March 23, 1847) of its landscape development to
his brother, with a marginal sketch of his general idea:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I wrote shortly to father yesterday and now reply to
yours of the 18th inst.</p>

<p>I note what you say about Alsop’s and trees. I intend to
plant (trans-) but few ornamental trees and with them to
take great pains,—until I know where to put my house
exactly, I cannot arrange the lawn very well. The lawn
is to be the grand feature of my gardening. The ground is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
naturally graded and finely adapted for a broad, smooth
green plat broken only by a few trees or clumps, along on the
rear edge of it and so circling towards the shore, some low
thick shrubbery (a) is wanted. Back (cornering on b) I
suppose will be a good place for an orchard (beyond the proposed
barn). ’Tis there we are carting our manure now and
mean to plant corn and potatoes this year.</p>
</div>

<p class="center caption">Facsimile of Letter with Mr. Olmsted’s Earliest Sketch for Improvement
of Grounds, 1847</p>


<p>He consulted an architect regarding the proposed house,
having himself first made sketches of floor plans and determined
tentatively on a site. By November 10, 1847 he had
planted trees, which he describes in a letter to his brother:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We have planted 75 apple trees in first rate manner, 60
quinces, too. About a dozen ornamental forest trees on the
back bone of the point lot; which make quite a pretty show,—but
I do not think many of them will live.</p>
</div>

<p>Further improvements were not carried out at Sachem’s
Head on account of the relinquishment of this farm for the
larger and more promising place on Staten Island.</p>

<p>Mr. Frederick Kingsbury in 1903, after Mr. Olmsted’s
death, recalled the development of the Staten Island farm
and his friend’s beginning as a landscape improver. When
Mr. Kingsbury first visited the new farm, Mr. Olmsted explained
how he intended to improve its appearance.</p>

<p>Mr. Kingsbury notes:</p>

<p>“The house was simple yet picturesque. It had been
occupied by a tenant. The barns were quite near, and in the
rear of the house was a small pond, fifteen or twenty feet in
diameter, used for washing waggons, watering stock, and as
a swimming place for dogs, ducks and geese. There was no
turf near it. The whole place was as dirty and disorderly as
the most bucolic person could desire. It was on the surroundings
of the house that Olmsted first showed his genius
in landscape construction.</p>

<p>“He moved the barns and all their belongings behind a
knoll, he brought the road in so that it approached the house
by a graceful curve, he turfed the borders of the pond and
planted water plants on its edge and shielded it from all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
contamination. Thus, with a few strokes and at small expense
he transformed the place from a very dirty, disagreeable
farmyard to a gentleman’s house. This was his first
attempt at anything of the sort, and it was as successful as
anything he ever did.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kingsbury preserved a letter which his friend wrote
him in the fall of 1848, pursuing the subject of landscape
surroundings:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I am glad you are disposed to notice such things as Harral’s
house so much. The effect such things have on the
taste of a community,—and through that on their hearts and
lives—the elevation,—I believe is very much underestimated.</p>

<p>I do exceedingly enjoy the view from my house, sometimes
it is “wondrous beautiful”; just now for instance in
this charming sleepy autumn haze, I cannot attempt to
describe it, constantly changing, always renewedly interesting.
I can tell you a few features always present. The water
view extends over just half the circle. From the immediate
opposite front, to the left of the arc, it is bounded by the
horizon,—dark blue ocean, with forever distant sails coming
up or sinking as they bid good-bye to America. Then all
over that quarter at all distances are all sorts of vessels—at
anchor or under sail—and in all variety constantly shifting.
On the extreme right, across the water (Raritan Bay), the
horizon is broken by the hills of Jersey some twelve miles off,
I suppose. They sweep off gradually growing into something
like mountains as they curve round facing us; yet to the
front, suddenly and abruptly they end in a precipitous cliff
similar to their relations, the Palisades of N. River. This is
the Highland of Navesink, and we can just discern a cluster
of white towers upon its brink, the fixed and revolving lights
and the Telegraph Station.</p>

<p>A little beyond it (on the circle’s edge) you imagine the
horizon is half broken by a long yellowish white streak. It
is the sand and spray or foam of Sandy Hook, and the three
singularly distinct sails are nothing but its three white light-houses.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
There is yet another light in sight of us and in a
dark night these six lights are curiously interesting,—affecting
different minds with different ideas or feelings. To me
they present a cheerful, neighborhood effect. To a stranger
coming here in the dark it seems to me they must have a
very sociable look. It is almost impossible to realize their
distance. Staten Island I am sure you would like in itself,—there
are many charming inland views.</p>

<p>Since Mr. Olmsted’s particular interest in rural pursuits
dated from 1844 and Andrew Jackson Downing did not
meet his death until 1852, one naturally looks for some connection
between the two men. We know that Mr. Olmsted
contributed to the <i>Horticulturist</i>,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> that he had letters of
advice and introduction from Mr. Downing for his European
trip of 1850, and that he visited Downing at Newburgh, at
least once. Nevertheless, there is surprisingly little to be
found bearing definitely on their relations.</p>

<p>This subject was presented before the Boston Society of
Landscape Architects in 1916, by Mr. John C. Olmsted, in a
paper entitled “The Influence of A. J. Downing on the
Designers of Central Park,” from which the following is a
brief selection.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Those who knew A. J. Downing and have written about
him have made it clear that he was just the sort of man to
have had a marked influence on the young and impressionable
men who later became the designers of Central Park.
It is incontestable that he had every opportunity to impress
his knowledge and cultivated taste in subjects related to
park designing on at least the younger of those two young
men, namely Calvert Vaux, because he had brought Mr.
Vaux in the summer of 1850 from London, where he had been
a pupil and draughtsman in the office of a London architect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
named Truefitt, to act as his architectural assistant. He
soon advanced him to be his partner. Mr. Downing was
drowned about two years after he brought Mr. Vaux to this
country. Mr. Vaux no doubt took over the business of the
firm and completed the unfinished works. For that purpose
I think he continued to live in Newburgh for probably two
years or more, when he removed to New York City....</p>

<p>“Knowing how wide awake and keen for intellectual cultivation
and knowledge Mr. Calvert Vaux was, and having
listened to innumerable conversations of his, I can imagine
the profound influence upon the younger man of his intellectual
intercourse with his well read and thoughtful partner,
A. J. Downing....</p>

<p>“The other designer of Central Park, Frederick Law
Olmsted, it can well be imagined was somewhat influenced
by A. J. Downing, although for the most part indirectly
through the latter’s writings. I know he several times spoke
to me of A. J. Downing, but my recollection of what he said
is too vague to be of much help. I simply have the impression
that he had met and knew A. J. Downing both as a
social acquaintance and as a man, like himself, professionally
concerned in the education of the public in horticulture,
agriculture and rural taste.”</p>
</div>

<p>There is one letter preserved from Mr. Olmsted to Mr.
Downing, written after the former’s return from abroad.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Southside Staten Island</span>,<br>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Nov. 23, 1850.</span><br>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:</p>

<p>I wish to thank you for your kindness in sending me,
through Mr. Field last spring, a letter of introduction to Mr.
Thompson of London. I did not arrive in London in season
to attend the exhibition you wished me to, but I twice visited
the gardens and enjoyed valuable conversations with Mr.
Thompson, who was very obliging and communicative. I
took his advice as to what I should see in Paris, and I had
thought to offer you some account of what most interested
me there, but nearly all that was new and valuable of my observations
there has already now appeared in the <i>Horticulturist</i>
in the article by Mr. S. from the <i>Journal</i> of the London Soc’y.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>

<p>I spent only about one month on the Continent, mostly
Germany, where I much enjoyed the social out-door life, and
the frequent approaches to realizations of your <i>ideal village</i>.
The custom of taking meals in the gardens or summer houses
is very common; and it seemed to me the middle classes at
least <i>lived</i> in the open air more than even the English; nor
did it seem to me, as is frequently asserted, that their habits
in these respects injured the <i>family</i> influence, or made Home
any less home<i>like</i> and lovable, but the contrary.</p>

<p>I saw the best parts of England, spending two months
travelling through it on foot, seeing the country of course to
great advantage, so that I feel as if I had not merely seen the
rural character, but lived in it, and made it a <i>part</i> of me. I
was then two months in Ireland and Scotland.</p>

<p>I wish you would when convenient do us (your disciples
in Horticulture) the favor to explain distinctly the terms
used to describe the different ways of growing pears, etc. I
think your correspondents of the <i>Horticulturist</i> have generally
used the term Standard to designate pears grown on
pear stock only, and Dwarf for those on Quince or Thorn.
But in Europe does not Dwarf mean a low ill-shapen tree, or
a maiden tree that has lost its leader, and is only suitable for
walls?... I was disappointed at not finding the pear
grown on quince more abroad. Even at Paris I saw but few
in open culture. Those at the <i>Jardin des Plantes</i> and at the
Luxembourg are splendid full grown trees, and even this
bad season were as full as could be desired of fruit. At Versailles
they were mostly on trellis or walls—those <i>en quenouille</i>
invariably looked unhealthy.</p>

<p>I saw your <i>Fruits of America</i> in France and England and
Scotland; always shown as something for me to be proud of
as your countryman.</p>

<p class="right">
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">Yours Respectfully,</span><br>
<span class="smcap">Fred. Law Olmsted</span>.<br></P>
<p>Mr. A. J. Downing.<br>
</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>

<p>That the two men were regularly in correspondence on
subjects of professional interest may be inferred from a bit
in a letter to Charles Brace, not yet returned from the Continent,
Jan. 11, 1851: “I have written to Downing to tell
him who you are. He wants me to write him in familiar
letters Rough Impressions of Germany, etc. I find I cannot
do it. I saw and know too little of Germany to write distinctly
upon it, but I agree with him that whoever could do
it would be in the way of doing a good deal of small good.”</p>

<p>There is only a word to be found in the correspondence
of that period about Mr. Olmsted’s visit to Downing,—in a
letter to Fred. Kingsbury, Aug. 5, 1851: “I liked Ossining
and Newburgh.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> There is a piece in my book in one of the
<i>Horticulturists</i> this summer, on Birkenhead Park mostly.”</p>

<p>In an article by Mrs. Van Rensselaer in the <i>Century</i> for
October, 1893, based directly on reminiscences which Mr.
Olmsted gave her in conversation, it is stated that he visited
Downing at Newburgh and made the acquaintance of Calvert
Vaux.</p>

<p>The second volume<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> of Mr. Olmsted’s first book, <i>Walks
and Talks</i> (1852), contained the following dedication:</p>

<p class="center">
To the Memory of<br>
<span class="smcap">Andrew Jackson Downing</span>:<br>
Whatever of good, true, and pleasant thought this<br>
volume may contain, is humbly and<br>
reverently inscribed.<br>
</p>

<p>Mr. Olmsted left among his papers a jotting evidently
intended to be used in beginning an address for some occasion
or other.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A. J. Downing</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This is not a rhetorical introduction to my subject; it is
a plain statement of one of the conclusions of a special study
from which I have been led to regard Mr. Downing as a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
benefactor of our race and to desire almost above all things
to do something to extend and prolong his influence. Although
he had a philosophic turn of mind, I do not doubt
that he builded better than he knew in that the plans and
instructions which he gave to the public were far less excellent
with reference to their ostensible ends, than they were
with reference to the purpose of stimulating the exercise of
judgment and taste in the audience addressed.</p>
</div>

<p>There are also a number of little sheets which Mr. Olmsted
had had printed off, perhaps for the same occasion, and
perhaps for some other public use, bearing the following
quotation,—which expresses Mr. Olmsted’s own ideals of
democracy as well:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“And yet this broad ground of popular refinement must be
taken in republican America, for it belongs of right more truly
here than elsewhere. It is republican in its very idea and tendency.
It takes up popular education where the common school
and ballot-box leave it, and raises up the working man to the
same level of enjoyment with the man of leisure and accomplishment.
The higher social and artistic elements of every man’s
nature lie dormant within him, and every laborer is a possible
gentleman, not by the possession of money or fine clothes, but
through the refining influence of intellectual and moral culture.
Open wide, therefore, the doors of your libraries and picture
galleries, all ye true republicans! Build halls where knowledge
shall be freely diffused among men, and not shut up within the
narrow walls of narrower institutions. Plant spacious parks in
your cities, and unloose their gates as wide as the gates of morning
to the whole people. As there are no dark places at noon day, so
education and culture—the true sunshine of the soul—will banish
the plague spots of democracy; and the dread of the ignorant
exclusive, who has no faith in the refinement of a republic, will
stand abashed in the next century, before a whole people whose
system of voluntary education embraces (combined with perfect
individual freedom), not only common schools of rudimentary
knowledge, but common enjoyments for all classes in the higher
realms of art, letters, science, social recreations, and enjoyments.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
Were our legislators but wise enough to understand, today, the
destinies of the New World, the gentility of Sir Philip Sidney,
made universal, would be not half so much a miracle fifty years
hence in America as the idea of a whole nation of laboring-men
reading and writing, was, in his day, in England.”</p>

regard to the memorial to Mr. Downing appropriately proposed
to be erected in the Central Park but never carried out,
and again in 1889 with reference to the Downing memorial
park at Newburgh. Mrs. Downing,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> who afterwards married

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br><span class="small">LANDSCAPE OBSERVATIONS FROM EUROPEAN TRAVEL</span></h3></div>


<p>We know from Mr. Olmsted’s own words that he had a
particular interest in visiting parks both on his first European
journey of 1850, and in 1856, when he was abroad attending
to his publishing business and travelling also somewhat with
his sisters. In his <i>Walks and Talks of an American Farmer
in England</i>, first published in 1852, there are a number of
passages which should be quoted here, particularly as showing
the trained observation of scenery which he later brought
to his landscape designing, and his keen interest in the social
and economic aspects of rural life.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> It is interesting to know,
too, that the book was illustrated by his own sketches.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span></p>

<p>Although he went primarily as a farmer, he had in mind
to see all sides of the country. He wrote to his father before
sailing: “I can have now the advantage of letters from Norton
to the Scotch farmers, from Field to the English, from
Antisell to the Irish. They all have warm friends there yet
among just the men I want to learn from. Parsons will
introduce me to the gardens and nurseries. Prof. Johnston
returns to Edinboro, Judge Emerson and Stevens direct me
to the lions of London, and Field opens the manufacturies.”</p>


<h4>BIRKENHEAD AND ITS PARK</h4>

<p>Birkenhead is the most important suburb of Liverpool,
having the same relation to it that Charlestown has to Boston
or Brooklyn to New York. When the first line of Liverpool
packets was established, there were not half a dozen houses
here; it now has a population of many thousands, and is
increasing with a rapidity hardly paralleled in the New
World. This is greatly owing to the very liberal and enterprising
policy of the land-owners, which affords an example
that might be profitably followed in the vicinity of many of
our own large towns. There are several public squares, and
the streets and places are broad, and well paved and lighted.
A considerable part of the town has been built with reference
to general effect, from the plans and under the direction of a
talented architect, Gillespie Graham....</p>

<p>The baker had begged of us not to leave Birkenhead
without seeing their <i>new park</i>, and at his suggestion we left
our knapsacks with him, and proceeded to it. As we approached
the entrance, we were met by women and girls,
who, holding out a cup of milk, asked us—“<i>Will you take a
cup of milk, sirs?—good, cool, sweet, cow’s milk, gentlemen, or
right warm from the ass!</i>” And at the gate was a herd of
donkeys, some with cans of milk strapped to them, others
saddled and bridled, to be let for ladies and children to ride.</p>

<p>The gateway, which is about a mile and a half from the
ferry, and quite back of the town, is a great, massive block of
handsome Ionic architecture, standing alone, and unsupported<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
by any thing else in the vicinity, and looking, as I
think, heavy and awkward. There is a sort of grandeur
about it that the English are fond of, but which, when it is
entirely separate from all other architectural constructions,
always strikes me unpleasantly. It seems intended as an
impressive preface to a great display of art within; but here,
as well as at Eaton Park, and other places I have since seen,
it is not followed up with great things, the grounds immediately
within the grand entrance being very simple, and
apparently rather overlooked by the gardener. There is a
large archway for carriages, and two smaller ones for those on
foot, and, on either side, and over these, are rooms, which
probably serve as inconvenient lodges for the labourers.
No porter appears, and the gates are freely open to the
public.</p>

<p>Walking a short distance up an avenue, we passed
through another light iron gate into a thick, luxuriant and
diversified garden. Five minutes of admiration, and a few
more spent in studying the manner in which art had been
employed to obtain from nature so much beauty, and I was
ready to admit that in democratic America there was nothing
to be thought of as comparable with this People’s Garden.
Indeed, gardening had here reached a perfection that I had
never before dreamed of. I cannot undertake to describe
the effect of so much taste and skill as had evidently been
employed; I will only tell you, that we passed by winding
paths over acres and acres, with a constant varying surface,
where on all sides were growing every variety of shrubs and
flowers, with more than natural grace, all set in borders of
greenest, closest turf, and all kept with most consummate
neatness. At a distance of a quarter of a mile from the gate,
we came to an open field of clean, bright green-sward, closely
mown, on which a large tent was pitched, and a party of boys
in one part, and a party of gentlemen in another, were playing
cricket. Beyond this was a large meadow with rich
groups of trees, under which a flock of sheep were reposing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
and girls and women with children, were playing. While
watching the cricketers, we were threatened with a shower,
and hastened back to look for shelter, which we found in a
pagoda, on an island approached by a Chinese bridge. It
was soon filled, as were the other ornamental buildings, by a
crowd of those who, like ourselves, had been overtaken in the
grounds by the rain; and I was glad to observe that the
privileges of the garden were enjoyed about equally by all
classes. There were some who were attended by servants,
and sent at once for their carriages, but a large proportion
were of the common ranks, and a few women with children,
or suffering from ill health, were evidently the wives of very
humble labourers. There were a number of strangers, and
some we observed with notebooks and portfolios, that seemed
to have come from a distance to study from the garden.
The summer-houses, lodges, bridges, etc., were all well constructed,
and of undecaying materials. One of the bridges
which we crossed was of our countryman Remington’s patent,
an extremely light and graceful erection.</p>

<p>I obtained most of the following information from the
head working-gardener.</p>

<p>The site of the park and garden was, ten years ago, a
flat, sterile clay farm. It was placed in the hands of Mr.
Paxton, in June, 1844, by whom it was laid out in its present
form by June of the following year. Carriage roads, thirty-four
feet wide, with borders of ten feet, and walks varying
in width, were first drawn and made. The excavation for a
pond was also made, and the earth obtained from these
sources used for making mounds and to vary the surface,
which has been done with much <i>naturalness</i> and taste. The
whole ground was thoroughly under-drained, the minor
drains of stone, the main, of tile. By these sufficient water
is obtained to fully supply the pond, or lake, as they call it,
which is from twenty to forty feet wide, and about three feet
deep, and meanders for a long distance through the garden.
It is stocked with aquatic plants, gold fish and swans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>

<p>The roads are macadamized. On each side of the carriage
way, and of all the walks, pipes for drainage are laid, which
communicate with deep main drains that run under the edge
of all the mounds or flower beds. The walks are laid first
with six inches of fine broken stone, then three inches cinders,
and the surface with six inches of fine rolled gravel. All the
stones on the ground which were not used for these purposes,
were laid in masses of rock-work, and mosses and rock-plants
attached to them. The mounds were then planted with
shrubs, and heaths and ferns, and the beds with flowering
plants. Between these, and the walks and drives, is everywhere
a belt of turf (which, by the way, is kept close cut with
short, broad scythes, and shears, and swept with <i>hair-brooms</i>,
as we saw). Then the rural lodges, temple, pavilion, bridges,
<i>orchestra for a band of instrumental music</i>, <i>etc.</i>, were built.
And so, in one year, the skeleton of this delightful garden
was complete.</p>

<p>But this is but a small part. Besides the cricket and an
archery ground, large valleys were made verdant, extensive
drives arranged, plantations, clumps, and avenues of trees
formed, and a large park laid out. And all this magnificent
pleasure-ground is entirely, unreservedly, and for ever the
people’s own. The poorest British peasant is as free to enjoy
it in all its parts as the British queen. More than that, the
baker of Birkenhead has the pride of an OWNER in it.</p>

<p>Is it not a grand good thing? But you are inquiring who
<i>paid</i> for it. The honest owners—the most wise and worthy
townspeople of Birkenhead—in the same way that the New
Yorkers pay for “the Tombs” and the Hospital, and the
<i>cleaning</i> (as they amusingly say) of their streets.</p>

<p>Of the farm which was purchased, one hundred and
twenty acres have been disposed of in the way I have described.
The remaining sixty acres, encircling the park and
garden, were reserved to be sold or rented, after being well
graded, streeted, and planted, for private building lots.
Several fine mansions are already built on these (having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
private entrances to the park), and the rest now sell at $1.25
a square yard. The whole concern cost the town between
five and six hundred thousand dollars. It gives employment,
at present, to ten gardeners and labourers in summer, and to
five in winter.</p>

<p>The generous spirit and fearless enterprise that has accomplished
this, has not been otherwise forgetful of the
health and comfort of the poor. Among other things, I
remember, a public washing and bathing house for the town
is provided. I should have mentioned also, in connection
with the market, that in the outskirts of the town there is a
range of stone slaughter-houses, with stables, yards, pens,
supplies of hot and cold water and other arrangements and
conveniences, that enlightened regard for health and decency
would suggest.</p>

<p>The consequence of all these sorts of things is, that all
about the town lands, which a few years ago were almost
worthless wastes, have become of priceless value; where no
sound was heard but the bleating of goats and braying of
asses complaining of their pasturage, there is now the hasty
click and clatter of many hundred busy trowels and hammers.
You may drive through wide and thronged streets of
stately edifices, where were only a few scattered huts, surrounded
by quagmires. Docks of unequalled size and
grandeur are building, and a forest of masts grows along the
shore; and there is no doubt that this young town is to be not
only remarkable as a most agreeable and healthy place of
residence, but that it will soon be distinguished for extensive
and profitable commerce. It seems to me to be the only
town I ever saw that has been really built at all in accordance
with the advanced science, taste and enterprising spirit
that are supposed to distinguish the nineteenth century. I
do not doubt it might be found to have plenty of exceptions
to its general character, but I did not inquire for these, nor
did I happen to observe them. Certainly, in what I have
noticed, it is a model town, and may be held up as an example<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
not only to philanthropists and men of taste, but to speculators
and men of business.</p>

<p>After leaving the park, we ascended a hill, from the top
of which we had a fine view of Liverpool and Birkenhead.
Its sides were covered with villas, with little gardens about
them. The architecture was generally less fantastic, and the
style and materials of building more substantial than is
usually employed in the same class of residences with us.
Yet there was a good deal of the same <i>stuck up</i> and uneasy
pretentious air about them that the suburban houses of our
own city people so commonly have. Possibly this is the
effect of association, in my mind, of steady, reliable worth
and friendship with plain or old-fashioned dwellings, for I
often find it difficult to discover in the buildings themselves
the element of such expression. I am inclined to think it is
more generally owing to some disunity in the design,—often,
perhaps, to a want of keeping between the mansion and its
grounds or its situation. The architect and the gardener do
not understand each other, and commonly the owner or
resident is totally at variance in his tastes and intentions
from both; or the man whose ideas the plan is made to serve,
or who pays for it, has no true independent taste, but had
fancies to be accommodated, which only follow confusedly
after custom or fashion. I think, with Ruskin, it is a pity
that every man’s house cannot be really his own, and that
he can not make all that is true, beautiful, and good in his
own character, tastes, pursuits, and history manifest in it.</p>

<p>But however fanciful and uncomfortable many of the
villa houses about Liverpool and Birkenhead appear at first
sight, the substantial and thorough manner in which most
of them are built will atone for many faults. The friendship
of nature has been secured to them. Dampness, heat, cold,
will be welcome to do their best. Every day they will improve.
In fifty or a hundred years fashions may change,
and they will appear, perhaps, quaint, possibly grotesque;
but still strong, home-like, and hospitable. They have no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
shingles to rot, no glued and puttied and painted gimcrackery
to warp and crack and moulder; and can never look so
shabby, and desolate, and dreary, as will nine-tenths of the
buildings of the same denomination now erecting about
New York, almost as soon as they lose the raw, cheerless,
imposter-like airs which seem almost inseparable from their
newness.</p>


<h4>A FERME ORNÉE</h4>

<p>A few miles further on we came to a large, park-like
pasture, bounded by a neatly trimmed hedge, and entered
by a simple gate, from which a private road ran curving
among a few clumps of trees to a mansion about a furlong
distant. We entered, and rested ourselves awhile at the foot
of some large oaks. The house was nearly hidden among
trees, and these, seen across the clear grass land, were the
finest groups of foliage we had ever seen. A peculiar character
was given it by one or two <i>copper-leaved</i> beeches—large,
tall trees, thickly branched from the very surface of the
ground. (These trees, which are frequently used with great
good effect in landscape gardening in England, are rare in
America, though they may be had at the nurseries. There
are two sorts, one much less red than the other.) The cattle
in this pasture-lawn were small and black, brisk and wild-looking,
but so tame in reality, that as we lay under the tree,
they came up and licked our hands like dogs. The whole
picture completely realized Willis’s beautiful ideal, “The
Cottage <i>Insoucieuse</i>.”</p>


<h4>EATON PARK</h4>

<p>In the afternoon we walked to Eaton Park.</p>

<p>Probably there is no object of art that Americans of
cultivated taste generally more long to see in Europe than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
an English park. What artist so noble, has often been my
thought, as he who, with far-reaching conception of beauty
and designing power, sketches the outline, writes the colours,
and directs the shadows of a picture so great that Nature
shall be employed upon it for generations, before the work
he has arranged for her shall realize his intentions.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>... We came to the great castellated edifice that I have
before spoken of as the gateway to the park. Such we were
told it was, and were therefore surprised to find within only
a long, straight road, with but tolerable mowing lots alternating
by the side of it, with thick plantations of trees, no
way differing from the twenty-year old natural wood of my
own farm, except that hollies, laurels, and our common dogwood
were planted regularly along the edge.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>We tramped on for several miles through this tame
scenery and most ungentlemanly farming, until it became
really tiresome. At length the wood fell back, and the road
was lined for some way with a double row of fine elms. Still
no deer. A little further, and we came to a cottage most
beautifully draped with ivy; passed through another gate.
Ah! here is the real park at last.</p>

<p>A gracefully, irregular, gently undulating surface of close-cropped
pasture land, reaching way off inimitably; dark
green in colour; very old, but not very large trees scattered
singly and in groups—so far apart as to throw long unbroken
shadows across broad openings of light, and leave the view
in several directions unobstructed for a long distance. Herds
of fallow-deer, fawns, cattle, sheep and lambs quietly feeding
near us, and moving slowly in masses at a distance; a warm
atmosphere, descending sun, and sublime shadows from
fleecy clouds transiently darkening in succession, sunny
surface, cool woodside, flocks and herds, and foliage.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span></p>
<p>The road ran on winding through this. We drew a long
breath, and walked slowly for a little way, then turned aside
at the nearest tree, and lay down to take it all in satisfactorily.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>We concluded that the sheep and cattle were of the most
value for their effect in the landscape; but it was a little exciting
to us to watch the deer, particularly as we would sometimes
see them in a large herd leisurely moving across an
opening among the trees, a long way off, and barely distinguishable.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It is not my business to attempt a criticism of “the finest
specimen of the pointed Gothic” in England; but I may
honestly say that it did not, as a whole, produce the expected
effect of grandeur or sublimity upon us, without trying to
find reasons for the failure. Even when we came to look at it
closely, we found little to admire. There was no great simple
beauty in it as a mass, nor yet vigorous original character
enough in the details to make them an interesting study.
The edifice is long and low, and covered with an immense
amount of meaningless decoration.</p>

<p>Such was our first impression, and we were greatly disappointed,
you may be sure. We admired it more afterwards
on the other side, from the middle of a great garden, where it
seems to stand much higher, being set up on terraces, and
gaining much, I suspect, from the extension of architectural
character to the grounds in its front. Here we acknowledged
a good deal of magnificence in its effect. Still it seemed as if
it might have been obtained in some other style, with less
labour, and was much frittered away in the confusion of
ornament.</p>

<p>This garden is a curiosity. It is in the geometrical style,
and covers eight acres, it is said, though it does not seem
nearly that to the eye. It is merely a succession of small
arabesque figures of fine grass or flower beds, set in hard,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
rolled, dark-coloured gravel. The surface, dropping by long
terraces from the steps of the hall to the river, is otherwise
only varied by stiff pyramidal yews and box, and a few vases.
On the whole, the effect of it in connection with the house,
and looking towards it, is good, more so than I should have
expected; and it falls so rapidly, that it affects the landscape
seen in this distance <i>from</i> the house but very little. This is
exquisitely beautiful, looking across the Dee, over a lovely
valley towards some high, blue mountains. From other parts
of the hall grand vistas open through long avenues of elms,
and there are some noble single trees about the lawn.</p>

<p>This English elm is a much finer tree than I had been
aware of—very tall, yet with drooping limbs and fine thick
foliage; not nearly as fine as a single tree as our elm, but even
more effective, I think, in masses, because thicker and better
filled out in its general outline.</p>


<h4>ENGLISH LANDSCAPE</h4>

<p>I must say, that on the whole, the agriculture of Cheshire,
as the first sample of that of England which is presented to
me, is far below my expectations. There are sufficient
reasons to expect that we shall find other parts much superior
to it; but what we have seen quite disposes of the common
picture which our railroad and stage-coach travellers are in
the habit of giving to our imagination, by saying that “all
England is like a garden.” Meaning only a “landscape
garden,” a beautiful and harmonious combination of hill and
dale, with the richest masses of trees, and groups and lines of
shrubbery, the greenest turf and most picturesque buildings,
it might be appropriately said of many parts, particularly in
the south of the country. But, with reference to cultivation,
and the productiveness of the land, it might be quite as truly
applied to some small districts of our own country as to this
part of England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>... We reach another lane and cultivated fields again,
and, being on elevated ground at the knarly feet of a glorious,
breezy, gray, old beech-tree, lay ourselves down, and,
looking back upon the extensive landscape, tell our friend
in what it differs from American scenery.</p>

<p>The great beauty and peculiarity of the English landscape
is to be found in the frequent long, graceful lines of
deep green hedges and hedge-row timber, crossing hill,
valley, and plain, in every direction; and in the occasional
large trees, dotting the broad fields, either singly or in small
groups, left to their natural open growth, (for ship-timber,
and, while they stand, for cattle shades,) therefore branching
low and spreading wide, and more beautiful, much more
beautiful, than we often allow our trees to make themselves.
The less frequent brilliancy of broad streams or ponds of
water, also distinguishes the prospect from those we are
accustomed to, though there are often small brooks or pools,
and much marshy land, and England may be called a well-watered
country. In the foreground you will notice the
quaint buildings, generally pleasing objects in themselves,
often supporting what is most agreeable of all, and what you
can never fail to admire, never see any thing ugly or homely
under, a curtain of ivy or other creepers; the ditches and the
banks by their side, on which the hedges are planted; the
clean and careful cultivation, and general tidiness of the
agriculture; and the deep, narrow, crooked, gulch-like lane,
or the smooth, clean, matchless, broad highway. Where
trees are set in masses for ornament, the Norway spruce and
the red beech generally give a dark, ponderous tone, which
we seldom see in America; and in a hilly and unfertile country
there are usually extensive patches of the larch, having a
brown hue. The English elm is the most common tree in
small parks or about country-houses. It appears, at a little
distance, more like our hickory, when the latter grows upon
a rich soil, and is not cramped, as sometimes in our river
intervals, than any other American tree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>There seems to me to be a certain peculiarity in English
foliage, which I can but little more than allude to, not having
the skill to describe. You seem to see each particular
leaf, (instead of a confused leafiness,) more than in our trees;
or it is as if the face of each leaf was parallel, and more
equally lighted than in our foliage. It is perhaps only owing
to a greater density, and better filling up, and more even
growth of the outer twigs of the trees, than is common in our
drier climate. I think that our maple woods have more
resemblance to it than others.</p>

<p>There is usually a much milder light over an English
landscape than an American, and the distance and shady
parts are more indistinct. It is rare that there is not a
haziness, slightly like that of our Indian summer in the
atmosphere, and the colours of every thing, except of the
foliage are less brilliant and vivacious than we are accustomed
to. The sublime or the picturesque in nature is
much more rare in England, except on the sea-coast, than in
America; but there is every where a great deal of quiet,
peaceful, graceful beauty, which the works of man have
generally added to, and which I remember but little at
home that will compare with. This Herefordshire reminds
me of the valley in Connecticut, between Middletown and
Springfield. The valley of the Mohawk and the upper
part of the Hudson, is also in some parts English-like.</p>

<p>Soon after leaving Warminster, began a very different
style of landscape from what I have before seen: long
ranges and large groups of high hills with gentle and gracefully
undulating slopes; broad and deep cells between and
within them, through which flow in tortuous channels
streamlets of exceedingly pure, sparkling water. These
hills are bare of trees, except rarely a close body of them,
covering a space of perhaps an acre, and evidently planted
by man. Within the shelter of these you will sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
see that there is a large farm-house with a small range of
stables. The valleys are cultivated, but the hills in greater
part are covered, without the slightest variety, except what
arises from the changing contour of the ground, with short,
wiry grass, standing thinly, but sufficiently close to give the
appearance at a little distance from the eye, of a smooth,
velvety, green surface. Among the first of the hills I observed,
at a high elevation, long angular ramparts and earth-works,
all greened over. Within them at the summit of the
hill were several extensive tumuli, evidently artificial,
(though I find nothing about it in the books,) and on the top
of one of these was a shepherd and dog and a large flock of
sheep, clear and coldly distinct, and appearing of gigantic
size against the leaden clouds behind. In the course of the
day I met with many of these flocks, and nearly all of the
hill-land seemed given up to them. I was upon the border,
in fact, of the great <i>Southdown</i> district, and, during the next
week, the greater part of the country through which we
were travelling, was of the same general character of landscape,
though frequently not as green, varied, and pleasing
as in these outskirts of it.</p>


<h4>THE DESCRIPTION OF SCENERY</h4>

<p>There is always a strong temptation upon the traveller
to endeavor to so describe fine scenery, and the feelings
which it has occasioned him, that they may be reproduced to
the imagination of his friends. Judging from my own experience,
this purpose always fails. I have never yet seen
any thing celebrated in scenery, of which I had previously
obtained a correct conception. Certain striking, prominent
points, that the power of language has been most directed
to the painting of, almost invariably disappoint, and seem
little and commonplace, after the exaggerated forms which
have been brought before the mind’s eye. Beauty, grandeur,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
impressiveness, in any way, from scenery, is not often to be
found in a few prominent, distinguishable features, but in
the manner and the unobserved materials with which these
are connected and combined. Clouds, lights, states of the
atmosphere, and circumstances that we cannot always detect,
affect all landscapes, and especially landscapes in which
the vicinity of a body of water is an element, much more than
we are often aware. So it is that the impatient first glance
of the young traveller, or the impertinent critical stare of
the old tourist, is almost never satisfied, if the honest
truth be admitted, in what it has been led to previously
imagine. I have heard “Niagara is a mill-dam,” “Rome is
a humbug.”</p>

<p>The deep sentiments of nature that we sometimes seem
to have been made the confidant of, when among the mountains,
or on the moors or the ocean,—even those of man
wrought out in architecture and sculpture and painting, or
of man working in unison with Nature, as sometimes in
the English parks, on the Rhine, and here on the Isle of
Wight,—such revealings are beyond words; they never
could be transcribed into note-books and diaries, and so descriptions
of them become caricatures, and when we see
them, we at first say we are disappointed that we find not
the monsters we were told of.</p>

<p>Dame Nature is a gentlewoman. No guide’s fee will
obtain you her favour, no abrupt demand; hardly will she
bear questioning, or direct, curious gazing at her beauty;
least of all, will she reveal it truly to the hurried glance of
the passing traveller, while he waits for his dinner, or fresh
horses, or fuel and water; always we must quietly and unimpatiently
wait upon it. Gradually and silently the charm
comes over us; the beauty has entered our souls; we know
not exactly when or how, but going away we remember it
with a tender, subdued, filial-like joy.</p>

<p>Does this seem nonsense to you? Very likely, for I am
talking of what I don’t understand. Nature treats me so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
strangely; it’s past my speaking sensibly of, and yet, as a
part of my travelling experience, I would speak of it. At
times I seem myself to be her favourite, and she brings me to
my knees in deep feeling, such as she blesses no other with;
oftener I see others in ecstasies, while I am left to sentimentalize
and mourn, or to be critical, and sneering, and infidel.
Nonsense still; but tell me, do you think it is only for greed
of trouts that your great and sensitive man lingers long, intently
stooping over dark pools in the spray of the mountain
torrents, or stealing softly a way through the bending
rushes, or kneeling lowly on the darkest verdure of the
shaded meadow? What else? I know not what he thinks,
but of this I am assured: while his mind is most intent upon
his trivial sport, his heart and soul will be far more absorbent
of the rugged strength, the diffuse, impetuous brilliance,
the indefinite gliding grace, or the peaceful twilight loveliness,
of the scenes around him, than if he went out searching,
labouring directly for it as for bread and fame.</p>

<p>The greater part of the Isle of Wight is more dreary, desolate,
bare, and monotonous than any equal extent of land
you probably ever saw in America—would be, rather, if it
were not that you are rarely out of sight of the sea; and no
landscape, of which that is a part, ever can be without variety
and ever-changing interest. It is, in fact <i>down-land</i> in the
interior, exactly like that I described in Wiltshire, and sometimes
breaking down into such bright dells as I there told of.
But on the south shore it is rocky, craggy; and after you have
walked through a rather dull country, though pleasing on
the whole, for hours after landing, you come gradually to
where the majesty of vastness, peculiar to the downs and the
ocean, alternates or mingles with dark, picturesque, rugged
ravines, chasms, and water-gaps, sublime rock-masses, and
soft, warm smiling inviting dells and dingles; and, withal,
there is a strange and fascinating enrichment of half-tropical
foliage, so deep, graceful, and luxuriant, as I never saw before
any where in the world. All this district is thickly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
inhabited, and yet so well covered with verdure, or often so
tastefully appropriate—quiet, cosy, ungenteel, yet elegant—are
the cottages, that they often add to, rather than insult
and destroy, the natural charm of their neighbourhood. I
am sorry to say, that among the later erections there are a
number of very strong exceptions to this remark.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>As to Mr. Olmsted’s travels in 1856, we have a memorandum
that he visited Rome, Genoa, Florence, Prague,
Leipzig, and Dresden as well as London. We have a delightful
reference to his brief Italian visit in a letter written
to Charles Eliot, then abroad, March 4, 1886:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I think that you want to get hints for gardening in dry,
hot regions of our country from Italy, Spain and south of
France. You do not, it seems to me, get much of value
from the show villas to which you go as a matter of course.
But I remember modester places which struck me as delightful,
and one or two that I cannot now specify I made my
way into and faintly recall always when I think of what
should be done in California, Colorado, New Mexico, or
really in Georgia and Florida. I speak of a month in all
Italy more than thirty years ago when I had no more
thought of being a landscape architect than of being a
Cardinal. Yet my experience has been of much value to me.</p>

have spent, previous to my own journey, a great many long winter evenings in
reading the books so frequently written by our literary tourists, upon England;
and although I do not recollect one of them, the author of which was a farmer,
or whose habits of life, professional interests, associations in society, and ordinary
standards of comparison were not altogether different from my own, I

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br><span class="small">SOUTHERN TRIPS, 1852-1854</span></h3>
</div>


<p>From the letters and books relating to his Southern
journeys, there is less of scenery or of rural art. He was
concerned with giving a true picture of the economic and
social conditions in the South, especially as affected by
slavery, and his observations were directed mainly to men
and their affairs rather than to their landscape surroundings.
There are, however, numerous passages of great interest in
this regard, especially on the Texas journey of 1853-4.
Several are here given.</p>

<p>One is written from San Antonio, Texas, March 12, 1854,
to a friend.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Meantime we are traveling about, without definite aim,
in an original but, on the whole, very pleasant fashion.
The spring here is very beautiful, the prairies are not mere
seas of coarse grass, but one of varied surface, with thick
wooded borders and many trees and shrubs, standing singly
and in small islands. Having been generally burnt over or
the rank grass fed closely down, they have very frequently
a fine close lawn-like turf, making an extremely rich landscape.
At this season, moreover, there are a very great
variety of pretty, small, modest flowers, such as I send you,
growing often very thickly in the grass. There is an evergreen
shrub rare, and new to me, which is the finest shrub
I have ever seen.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Its leaves are Acacia-like but evergreen,
bright and glossy like Laurel, and it bears a cluster like those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
of the Horsechestnut, of deep blue and lilac bloom, with
a perfume like that of grapes.</p>


<h4>THE WESTERN PRAIRIES</h4>

<p>The impression as we emerged, strengthened by a warm,
calm atmosphere, was very charming. The live-oaks,
standing alone or in picturesque groups near and far upon
the clean sward, which rolled in long waves that took, on
their various slopes, bright light or half shadows from the
afternoon sun, contributed mainly to an effect which was
very new and striking, though still natural, like a happy
new melody. We stopped, and, from the trunk of a superb
old tree, preserved a sketched outline of its low gnarled
limbs, and of the scene beyond them.</p>

<p>Had we known that this was the first one of a thousand
similar scenes, that were now to charm us day after day, we
should have, perhaps, spared ourselves the pains. We were,
in fact just entering a vast region of which live-oak
prairies are the characteristic. It extends throughout the
greater part of Western Texas, as far as the small streams
near San Antonio, beyond which the dwarf mesquit and its
congeners are found. The live-oak is almost the only tree
away from the river bottoms, and everywhere gives the
marked features to the landscape.</p>

<p>The live-oaks are often short, and even stunted in growth,
lacking the rich vigor and full foliage of those further east.
Occasionally, a tree is met with, which has escaped its share
of injury from prairie burnings and northers, and has grown
into a symmetrical and glorious beauty. But such are
comparatively rare. Most of them are meagerly furnished
with leaves, and as the leaf, in shape, size, and hue, has a
general similarity to that of the olive, the distant effect is
strikingly similar. As far West as beyond the Guadalupe,
they are thickly hung with the gray Spanish moss, whose
weird color, and slow, pendulous motions, harmonize peculiarly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
with the tone of the tree itself, especially where, upon
the round, rocky, mountain ledges, its distorted roots cling,
disputing a scant nourishment with the stunted grass.</p>

<hr class="tb">


<h4>SAN ANTONIO</h4>

<p>We have no city, except, perhaps, New Orleans, that can
vie, in point of the picturesque interest that attaches to
odd and antiquated foreignness, with San Antonio. Its
jumble of races, costumes, languages and buildings; its
religious ruins, holding to an antiquity, for us, indistinct
enough to breed an unaccustomed solemnity; its remote,
isolated, outposted situation, and the vague conviction that
it is the first of a new class of conquered cities into whose
decaying streets our rattling life is to be infused, combine
with the heroic touches in its history to enliven and satisfy
your traveller’s curiosity.</p>

<p>... [The streets] are laid out with tolerable regularity,
parallel with the sides of the main plaza, and are
pretty distinctly shared among the nations that use them.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In the outskirts of the town are many good residences,
recently erected by Americans. They are mostly of the
creamy limestone, which is found in abundance near by. It
is of a very agreeable shade, readily sawed and cut, sufficiently
durable, and can be procured at a moderate cost.
When the grounds around them shall have been put in
correspondence with the style of these houses, they will make
enviable homes.</p>

<hr class="tb">


<h4>THE SAN ANTONIO SPRING</h4>

<p>There are, besides the missions, several pleasant points
for excursions in the neighborhood, particularly those to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
San Antonio and San Pedro Springs. The latter is a
wooded spot of great beauty, but a mile or two from the
town, and boasts a restaurant and beer-garden beyond its
natural attractions. The San Antonio Spring may be
classed as of the first water among the gems of the natural
world. The whole river gushes up in one sparkling burst
from the earth. It has all the beautiful accompaniments of
a smaller spring, moss, pebbles, seclusion, sparkling sunbeams
and dense overhanging luxuriant foliage. The effect
is overpowering. It is beyond your possible conceptions
of a spring.</p>

<hr class="tb">


<h4>SEGUIN</h4>

<p>About a mile from the river we entered Seguin. It is the
prettiest town in Texas; at least of those we saw. It stands
on elevated ground, in a grove of shaggy live-oaks, which
have been left untouched, in their natural number and position,
the streets straying through them in convenient
directions, not always at right angles.</p>
</div>

<p>The following selections are from the <i>Back Country</i>
book:</p>


<h4>THE LANDSCAPE—ROSE HEDGES</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>For some miles about St. Francisville the landscape has
an open, suburban character, with residences indicative of
rapidly accumulating wealth, and advancement in luxury
among the proprietors. For twenty miles to the north of
the town, there is on both sides a succession of large sugar
and cotton plantations. Much land still remains uncultivated,
however. The roadside fences are generally hedges
of roses—Cherokee and sweetbrier. These are planted
first by the side of a common rail fence, which, while they
are young, supports them in the manner of a trellis; as they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
grow older they fall each way, and mat together, finally
forming a confused, sprawling, slovenly thicket, often ten
feet in breadth and four to six feet high. Trumpet creepers,
grape-vines, green-briers, and in very rich soil, cane, grow up
through the mat of roses, and add to its strength. It is not
as pretty as a trimmer hedge, yet very agreeable, and the
road being sometimes narrow, deep, and lane like, delightful
memories of England were often brought to mind.</p>

<hr class="tb">


<h4>THE BLUFF</h4>

<p>... The grand feature of Natchez is the bluff, terminating
in an abrupt precipice over the river, with the public
garden upon it. Of this I never had heard, and when, after
seeing my horse dried off and eating his oats with great
satisfaction,—the first time he has ever tasted oats, I suppose,—I
strolled off to see the town, I came upon it by surprise.
I entered a gate and walked up a slope, supposing
that I was approaching the ridge or summit of a hill, and
expecting to see beyond it a corresponding slope and the
town again, continuing in terraced streets to the river. I
found myself, almost at the moment I discovered that it was
not so, on the very edge of a stupendous cliff, and before
me an indescribably vast expanse of forest, extending on
every hand to a hazy horizon, in which, directly in front of
me, swung the round, red, setting sun.</p>

<p>Through the otherwise unbroken forest, the Mississippi
had opened a passage for itself, forming a perfect arc, the
hither shore of the middle of the curve being hidden under
the crest of the cliff, and the two ends lost in the vast obscurity
of the Great West. Overlooked from such an
eminence, the size of the Mississippi can be realized,—a
thing difficult under ordinary circumstances; but though the
fret of a swelling torrent is not wanting, it is perceptible only
as the most delicate chasing upon the broad, gleaming expanse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
of polished steel, which at once shamed all my previous
conceptions of the appearance of the greatest of rivers.
Coming closer to the edge and looking downward, you see
the lower town, its roofs with water flowing all around
them, and its pigmy people wading, and laboring to carry
upward their goods and furniture, in danger from a rising
movement of the great water. Poor people, emigrants
and niggers only.</p>

<p>I lay down, and would have reposed my mind in the infinite
vision westward, but was presently disturbed by a hog
which came grunting near me, rooting in the poor turf of
this wonderful garden. I rose and walked its length. Little
more has been done than to inclose a space along the edge,
which would have been dangerous to build upon, to cut out
some curving alleys now recaptured by the grass and weeds,
and to plant a few succulent trees. A road to the lower
town, cutting through it, is crossed by slight wooden foot-bridges,
and there are some rough plank benches—adorned
with stenciled “medical” advertisements. Some shrubs are
planted on the crumbling face of the cliff, so near the top
that the swine can obtain access to them. A man, bearded
and smoking, and a woman with him, sitting at the extreme
end, were the only visitors except myself and the swine.</p>

<p>Although in his <i>Walks and Talks</i> the public had ample
evidence of Mr. Olmsted’s taste in scenery, he was known
principally as a literary man, a writer on agriculture, and a
student of our social and economic conditions. His reasoned
observations had been widely circulated through his letters
in the New York <i>Times</i> and the books subsequently made
up from these,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> which are still considered to give the truest
picture of the South before the war. Mr. Raymond of the
<i>Times</i> is quoted in 1854 as thinking “highly of his powers of
observation and detailed reporting, giving just the facts
that people want.”</p>

<p>Among his intimates he was known as an enthusiast and
keen analyst in debate. It is pleasant to quote two references
to these qualities in letters, which were prophetic, in
spirit if not in exact detail:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span style="margin-right: 14.5em;"><span class="smcap">Boston</span>, May 8, 1847.</span><br>
(From <span class="smcap">F. J. Kingsbury</span> to <span class="smcap">J. H. Olmsted</span>.)<br>
</p>

<p>“It is pretty much all true what you say about Fred.
But living and growing and experience will have to answer
for him instead of college discipline. He is an enthusiast by
nature though, and all the Greek and Latin in the world
wouldn’t have driven that out of him. Well the world
needs such men, and one thing is curious, disappointments
never seem to trouble them. They must in the nature of
things meet with them often and yet they go right on in the
same old way just as if it had not happened. They never
get disheartened. I think Fred will be one of that sort.
Many of his favorite schemes will go to naught but he’ll
throw it aside and try another and spoil that and forget them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
both while you or I might have been blubbering over the
ruins of the first.”</p>
</div>

<p>And in the <i>Life and Letters of Charles Loring Brace</i>,<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> there
is a letter probably late in 1848:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I must say Fred is getting to argue with the utmost
keenness,—a regular Dr. Taylor mind in its analytic power!
But what is queerest, never able to exercise that power except
in discussion! He is another Taylorite in his virtue
theory. I shouldn’t be surprised if he turned out something
rather remarkable among men yet....”</p>
</div>

<p>Although he had not had a chance to prove his executive
ability in any public capacity, he was known as a capable
manager in the handling of farm labor. Very early in his
agricultural career, there is an evidence of this in a letter
(1848) to his brother:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I finally got things fixed so I could leave without much
anxiety. Robert returned, pretty well recovered; and work
cut out, with written directions, for every man of such sort
that they will be profitably and seasonably employed ’til I
return, without much need of judgment.</p>
</div>

<p>His democratic ideals in general were well understood
from his writings. There are some passages from letters
written early in his career as a landscape architect which
further interpret these with special regard to his chosen
profession.</p>

<p>The letter of 1860, addressed to a subordinate who had
referred to the difference in their “stations in life,” contains
the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The phrase “stations in life” is ordinarily used with a
meaning the propriety of which I am not accustomed to
recognize. That I have enjoyed greater advantages of
education in some respects than most of the keepers is true,
but so far as this means book-education, there is no man
among you who has it not in his power to obtain a better
education than mine, during the ordinary period of reserve
duty, within a very few years. As for my education in other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
respects, I mean in those respects which if anything entitle
me to my present position, I have obtained it by reason of no
advantages which many of you might not have had. The
best of my travelling has been done on foot at a cost of 70
cents a day, or working my passage as a common seaman.
My practical horticultural education, I mean that not gained
by reading, was in part acquired while engaged as a laborer,
looking to working men as my masters and teachers. It is
then impossible for me to have any hearty or habitual
respect for the superiority of one man over another in station
in life except as superiority of station means higher responsibility
and larger duty.</p>
</div>

<p>In 1863, when the political situation on the Central Park
made it difficult for Mr. Olmsted to entertain the idea of
returning to his work there, he wrote to Mr. Vaux from
California:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>But you know that the advantages offered in the office
of the Superintendent for spending a good deal of my life in
the park, being with the people in it, watching over it and
cherishing it in every way,—living in it and being a part of it
(whatever else there was),—were valued by me at a valuation
which you thought nonsensical, childish and unworthy of
me; but it was my valuation of them and not yours which
was concerned. And that this was something deeper than a
whim you know, for you know that it existed essentially
years before it attached itself to the Central Park as was
shown by the fact that while others gravitated to pictures,
architecture, Alps, libraries, high life and low life when
travelling, I had gravitated to parks,—spent all my spare
time in them, when living in London for instance, and this
with no purpose whatever except a gratification which came
from sources which the Superintendence of the Park would
have made easy and cheap to me, to say the least, every day
of my life. What I wanted in London and in Paris and in
Brussels and everywhere I went in Europe—what I wanted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
in New York in 1857, I want now <i>and this from no regard for
Art or fame or money</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Olmsted’s own summary of his fitness for the opportunity
which presented itself in 1857, he gave in <i>Spoils of
the Park</i>, written in 1882, to be reprinted in full in Volume
Two of this work.</p>

<p>It is worth while also, perhaps, to give in conclusion two
of the endorsements submitted with his Central Park
application in 1857. (See facsimile opposite.)</p>

<p>Similar petitions bear the signatures of Russell Sturgis,
Horace Greeley, George H. Putnam, Henry Holt, Whitelaw
Reid, William Cullen Bryant, Bayard Taylor, Alexander
Hamilton, Philip Schuyler, John M. Scribner, August Belmont,
Morris K. Jesup, Henry Havemeyer, E. D. Morgan,
Roosevelt &amp; Co., and many others.</p>

<p>Pleasantest of all was the letter from Professor Asa
Gray:</p>

<p>In September, 1857, when Frederick Law Olmsted was
appointed Superintendent of the Central Park in New York,
there was no well-established profession of landscape gardening
in the United States and the term landscape architect<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
was unknown. The untimely death of Andrew Jackson
Downing had come five years earlier. It was not until the
very end of 1857 that Downing’s architectural associate and
successor, Calvert Vaux, invited the new Superintendent of
the Central Park to participate with him in the competition
for the design, thus beginning a partnership which brought
about public recognition of a new professional field. It is
worth mentioning that the New York newspapers of the day
regarded only a few of the thirty-three<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> plans submitted
in the competition as worth attention, and characterized
many as puerile and entirely unsuitable. Of the four premiated
plans, the second was submitted by Mr. Samuel I.
Gustin, the superintendent of planting at the Park, the third
by Messrs. Miller and McIntosh, two employees in the office
of the Superintendent (Mr. Olmsted), and the fourth by an
architect, Mr. Howard Daniels,—none of these gentlemen
apparently enjoying any distinction in the public eye. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
competition plan of Colonel Viele, Chief Engineer, whose
original design for the Park had been rejected before the
institution of the competition, found no favor with the commissioners.
Mr. Ignaz A. Pilat, an Austrian, said to have
designed the grounds of Prince Metternich, and who had
been engaged since 1856 on a botanical survey of the ground
of the Central Park, submitted a design, although not in
competition. It would appear that no distinguished foreign
designer participated, although the Central Park Commissioners
had hoped for this, and had gone so far as to appropriate
money for the traveling expenses of the “engineers or
other persons in chief” by whom the Bois de Boulogne and
Birkenhead Park had been laid out and constructed, could
they be induced to visit New York for the purpose of giving
the Board “aid and information.”</p>

<p>At this time in Boston the firm of Copeland and Cleveland
(R. Morris Copeland and H. W. S. Cleveland) was engaged
in the professional practice of landscape gardening, mainly
the laying-out of suburban and country estates. In 1856
these gentlemen had published a very sensible pamphlet
modestly entitled <i>A Few Words on the Central Park</i>, in which
they urged on the City of New York the ultimate economy
of a comprehensive plan. Mr. Charles Follen, also of Boston,
was in practice at the time, styling himself “architect and
landscape gardener,” in his pamphlet, <i>Suggestions</i>, intended
for estate owners, issued in 1859. Both Mr. Copeland and
Mr. Follen submitted plans in the Central Park competition.</p>

<p>In a book published at Cincinnati early in 1855, called
<i>Practical Landscape Gardening</i>, the author, G. M. Kern,
refers to a flourishing state of the art of laying out grounds
in the Mississippi region and mentions especially Adolph
Strauch, of Cincinnati, now remembered as the designer of
Spring Grove Cemetery, which he undertook in that same
year, 1855. But the field in the West as in the East was
mainly restricted to private grounds, and the “many representatives”
mentioned by Mr. Kern remained obscure, most
of them perhaps <i>landschaftsgärtner</i> emigrated from Europe
with the influx of German settlers to the Middle West at this
period.</p>

<p>Outside of Downing’s writings, which were widely known,
there were few books on landscape gardening by American
writers, and few English books had gone into American editions.
Even in 1860, Mr. C. A. Dana, as editor of Appleton’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
<i>New American Cyclopedia</i>, wrote to Mr. Olmsted, from whom
Mr. Dana was soliciting an article on the title <i>Park</i>: “It is
curious that no Cyclopedia has an article on <i>Parks</i> or <i>Landscape
Gardening</i>;” remarking also: “We have no article,
nor is there in any part of the work, as yet, anything bearing
on that subject. Under Downing we give a simple biography
of the man and a list of his principal works.”</p>

<p>Mr. Olmsted frequently commented, in contrast, on the
advancement of the profession of landscape gardening in
Europe. In his article for Appleton’s Cyclopedia, we find
several passages, quite as true in 1857 as in 1861 when they
were published, bearing on this point:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Almost every large town in the civilized world now has
public pleasure grounds in some form....</p>

<p>Birkenhead park [which Mr. Olmsted had visited in 1850]<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
is a piece of ground of 185 acres in a suburb of Liverpool, and
is surrounded by villas the grounds of which connect with it.
Though small, it is by its admirable plan the most complete,
and for its age the most agreeable park in Europe. It was
designed and its construction superintended by Sir Joseph
Paxton and Mr. Kemp....</p>

<p>In the United States there is, as yet, scarcely a finished
park or promenade ground deserving mention. In the few
small fields of rank hay grasses and spindle-trunked trees,
to which the name is sometimes applied, the custom of the
promenade has never been established. Yet there is scarcely
a town or thriving village in which there is not found some
sort of inconvenient and questionable social exchange of this
nature. Sometimes it is a graveyard, sometimes a beach or
wharf, sometimes a certain part of a certain street; sometimes
interest in a literary or a charitable, a military, or even a
mercantile enterprise, is the ostensible object which brings
people together. But in its European signification the promenade
exists only in the limited grounds attached to the
capitol and to the “white house” at Washington, and in the
yet half-made park of New York....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span></p>

<p>Landscape gardening in the United States<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> has hitherto
been chiefly directed to the improvement of naturally wooded
scenery, and that on a small scale, yet in many instances, of
which the best are on the banks of the Hudson, with admirable
results. Publicly the art has been chiefly directed, also,
to the improvement of naturally wooded picturesque scenery
in the formation of rural cemeteries.</p>
</div>

<p>Turning from an analysis of the actual condition of the
landscape art, Mr. Olmsted mentions certain sources of
inspiration:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the various <i>Picturesque Tours</i> of Gilpin, and the
voluminous <i>Essays on the Picturesque</i> by Sir Uvedale Price,
the true principles of art applicable to the creation of scenery
were laboriously studied and carefully defined. Shenstone,
Mason and Knight, by their poems, materially aided the
revivification of the art. In more recent times the good
service of Repton, Loudon, Paxton, Kemp, our own Downing,
and other artists and writers on the subject during the present
century merits warm acknowledgment. Downing’s works
especially should be in every village school library.</p>
</div>

<p>A horticultural atmosphere pervaded the landscape work
of 1857. Downing’s <i>Horticulturist</i>, as its name implies, had
up to his death served not only as his own mouthpiece but
also a medium of communication for the many cultivated
gentlemen who were apt to prefer interesting specimen
plants to picturesque compositions. Downing himself ran
a nursery and reflected to a less degree the taste of the period
for a horticultural style. That conditions in the United
States were in general scarcely different thirty years later
shows against what odds the new profession had to make
headway. Writing in 1888 to one of a board of park commissioners
in Rochester, Mr. Olmsted might almost equally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
have been addressing a commissioner of 1858, had there been
park boards at that time outside of New York City.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>With reference to your undertaking there is less room for
choice than may be supposed among the landscape gardeners
or landscape architects of the country. (I have come to
prefer the latter term, tho’ I much objected to it when it was
first given me. I prefer it because it helps to establish the
important idea of the distinction of my profession from that
of gardening, as that of architecture from building—the
distinction of an art of <i>design</i>.)</p>

<p>Of those who have given themselves the title of landscape
gardeners not one of many more than a hundred have the
smallest right to it. As a rule they are further from it
than the average citizen of fair general education. This because
the most of them have passed the best educational
years of their lives in close and toilsome confinement to
matters horticultural, botanical and on a small scale decorative,
pursuing a course in this and other respects in which
faculties of close observation and handicraft skill are cultivated.
A course in fact such as you might prescribe for a
patient whom you wished to wean from too great susceptibility
to and interest in grasses, bushes and trees <i>as components
of natural scenery</i>. The gardening to which they apply
the term landscape is just that, in its essence, which the
term <i>landscape</i> gardening was first used as a means to rule
out of view.</p>

<p>Hamerton in his treatise of Landscape says that “scape”
in this word was from the same root and properly has the
same significance with ship, e. g. in friendship—meaning,
that is to say, the comprehensive state, to the eye, of the land
or region to which it is applied. (I should rather say the
character, broadly considered, of the scenery of a region.)
Of late the training of gardeners has been not at all to landscape
in this sense but to elements, incidents and features of
the materials of landscape considered by themselves; to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
them artists possibly in a certain way, as an ordinary house
furnisher may be trained to something of art in respect to
articles of furniture, pictures, books and bric-à-brac, but not
artists in respect to scenery, as scenery acts in the emotional
nature of some of us. That a training which is innocently
assumed to be a training in landscape gardening is a training
in fact away from it, I have often seen evidences. For example,
a man came to me with a letter of introduction in
which it was stated that he was a landscape gardener. As
the best feast that I could offer a visitor of this description
fresh from the old world, I dropped my business for
a day to take him up the Hudson. It was soon apparent
that he took less than ordinary interest in its natural scenery.
When we came near to the best of it I had to urge him to
move to a position on the boat where he could see it. Having
done so, in a minute or two he left it, and when near
West Point, I found him below sitting at a table with a bottle
of porter. Yet when I took him to the grounds of a friend’s
country-seat he proved to be really an enthusiast in particular
matters of gardening.</p>

<p>I have seen much of two of the most accomplished gardeners
in the United States but I never saw either of them
look at anything a stone’s throw away or show the slightest
interest in or understanding of landscape. There is nothing
to prevent them from presenting themselves in good faith
as landscape gardeners. In conversing with one previously
called a florist but who had offered himself and been appointed
landscape gardener of an important work, I found
that he applied the term ‘harmony,’ with reference to the
grouping of trees, on the supposition that it meant botanical
kinship. In the gap between two masses of fine indigenous
foliage he had planted some Chinese curios not only in complete
discord with them but where, if they lived long, they
would screen off his finest distant view.</p>

<p>Even of landscape gardening rightly so called, the practice
of most has been at best upon small grounds or upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
grounds in which the convenience and probable wants of
but a single family and its selected guests were to be considered,
a good design for which is a very different thing from
good design for grounds in which the movements of many
thousands are to be provided for and precautions taken not
only against careless and erratic movements but against
occasional malevolent torrents of a disorderly rabble.</p>

<p>Of the thirty-four plans of so many assumed landscape
gardeners offered to Commissioners of the Central Park in
1857, but one made the slightest provision for requirements
which everyone now sees it was absolutely necessary should
be provided for. If any one of the others had been adopted
an almost complete reconstruction of the Park would before
this time have been necessary. Among the plans offered,
that which, from the opportunities and well-earned reputation
of the planner, I had expected to be the best, aimed at
nothing more than a connected and diversified <i>series</i> of
effects appropriate to confined private suburban pleasure
grounds.</p>

<p>Of twenty-two plans obtained ten years ago by the Boston
Park Commissioners—several of which had cost the planners
over a thousand dollars each, and were most painstakingly
studied—even that which they adjudged to be the best was
after a few months entirely abandoned. (They finally came
to me for a plan which when published was bitterly denounced,
declared publicly, by an alleged landscape gardener
of large experience, wholly impracticable and so held up to
scorn that an association of citizens—large property holders—privately
employed a civil engineer to professionally examine
and report upon it. It has been carried out with no
essential variation and all objections have fallen to the
ground.)</p>

<p>I have written all the foregoing to justify the opinion I
now give you that in all Europe and America, among all the
men who with no dishonest intention take the name of landscape
gardeners (or architects) there are very few who have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
shown or are likely to possess any respectable power of dealing
with problems of the class that properly come before the
Park Commissioners of a large and growing city.</p>

<p>Of those among them likely to be available to you the man
of highest proved ability is my old partner Calvert Vaux of
New York. There are respects of design in which he is
probably the superior of any living man.... There are
in the country to my knowledge but two other (properly
speaking) landscape designers who have had any experience
that would specially qualify them to advise you.</p>

<p>One of them is H. W. S. Cleveland. He is a cultivated
Boston born and bred man, has been employed in responsible
positions on the public parks of Brooklyn, Chicago and
Minneapolis. He is the oldest landscape gardener in the
country....</p>

<p>The other is J. Weidenmann, the author of a book published
by the Appletons<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> on landscape gardening; a Swiss by
birth. He laid out and superintended for years, the public
park at Hartford, Conn....</p>

<p>No doubt there are other promising men whom I don’t
know or think of, for the profession is not organized and every
man fights on his own hook.</p>

<p>There are three or four men who tell fine stories of themselves
as landscape gardeners, even in some cases showing
what appear to be reputable testimonials, whom I should like
to caution you against but I do not feel quite justified in
mentioning them by names. One, an Englishman, I have
good reason to believe a knave. Another, a clever young
fiddler, comes from the north of Europe originally, later from
Paris. Another has published a pamphlet on Landscape
Gardening in which he aims to appear a man of Science and
shows himself a hopeless ignoramus.</p>

<hr class="tb">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
<p>If there were fewer pretenders to the landscape art in
1857, there was also an even less developed public taste, and
Mr. Olmsted could scarcely have been precipitated into a
field where his already recognized talent of literary expression
could have joined to greater advantage with his appreciation
of scenery, his latent genius as an artist, and his
knowledge as a practical farmer.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_21" href="#FNanchor_21" class="label">[21]</a> The term “Landscape Architecture” in a restricted sense (of Architecture
in Landscape) was used in England by Laing Meason in 1828 as the title
of a work which contained a discussion of Italian villas: <i>The Landscape Architecture
of the Great Painters of Italy</i>. This work was referred to in a Review of
Downing’s <i>Cottage Residences</i> and two other books on landscape gardening,

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
